sentence = "The outer coat is extremely thin, and full of pores ; but may be easily separated from the inner one, (which is much thicker), after the bean has been boiled, or lain • a few days in the soil. At the thick end of the bean, there is a small hole vilible to the naked eye, immediately over the radicle or future root, that it may have a free passage into the soil. Plate IV. fig. i. A. When these coats are taken off, the body of the feed appears, which is divided into two smooth portions or lobes. The smoothness of tire lobes is owing to a thin' film or cuticle with which they are covered. At the bafrs of the bean is placed the radicle or future root, Plate IV. fig. 3. A. The trunk of the radicle, just as it enters into the body of the feed, divides into two capital branches, one of which is inferred into each lobe, and sends off smaller ones in all direftions through the whole substance of the lobes, Plate IV. fig. 7. A A. These ramifications become so extremely minute towards the edges of the lobes, that they require the finest glasses to render them visible. To these ramifications Grew and Malpighius have given the name of feminal root; because, by means of it, the radicle and plume, before they are expanded, derive their principal nouriftiment. The plume, bud, or germ, Plate IV. fig. 3. is inclofed in two small corresponding cavities in each lobe. Its colour and consistence is much the same with those of the radicle, of which it is only a continuation; but having a quite contrary direction: For the radicle descends into the earth, and divides. into a great number of smaller branches or filaments ; but the plume alcends into the open air, and unfolds itself into all the beautiful variety of stem, branches, leaves, flowers, fruit, 6'\''c. The plume in com ftioots from the smaller end of the grain, and, among maltfters, goes by the name of acrofpire. The next thing to be taken notice of is the substance, or parenchymatous part of the lobes. This is not a mere concreted juice, but is curiously organifed, and consists of a vast number of small bladders resembling those in the pith of trees, Plate IV. fig. 4. Besides the coats, cuticle, and parenchymatous parts, there is a substance perfectly diftihft from these, distributed in different proportions through the radicle, plume, and lobes. This inner substance appears very plainly in a transverse feftion of the radicle or plume. Towards the extremity of the radicle, it is one entire trunk ; but higher up, it divides into three branches.; the middle one runs direcftly up to the plume, and the other two pass into the lobes on each side, .and spread out into a great variety of small branches through the whole body of the lobes, .Plate IV. fig. 7. This substance is very properly termed the feminal root: for when the feed is sown, the moisture is first absorbed by the outer coats, which are every where furniflied with sap and airvessels; from these it is conveyed to the cuticle; ’ from the cuticle it proceeds to the pulpy part of the lobes ; when it has got thus far, it is taken up by the mouths of the small branches of the feminal root, and passes from one branch into another, till it is all collefteft into the main trunk, which communicates both with the plume and radicle, the two principal involved organs of the future plant. After this the sap, or vegetable food, runs in two oppoVol.I. No. 2 . L T U R E. , 41 site diredtions ; part of it ascends into the plume, and promotes the growth and expansion of that organ ; and part of it Jefcends into the radicle, for nourishing and evolving the root and its various filaments. Thus the plume and radicle continue their progress in opposite directions, till the plant arrives at maturity. It is here worth remarking, that every plant is really pofleffed of two roots, both of which are contained in the feed. The plume and radicle, when the feed is first deposited in the earth, derive their nouriftiment from the feminal root: but, afterwards, when the radicle begins to ftioot out its filaments, and to absorb some moisture, not, however, in a sufficient quantity to supply the exigencies of the plume, the two lobes, or main body of the feed, rise along with the plume, aflume the appearance of two leaves, resembling the lobes of the leed in size and ftiape, but having no resemblance to those of the plume, for which reason they have got the name of dijjimilar leave'\'' s. These, diflimilar leaves defend the young plume from the injuries of the weather, and at the same time, by absorbing dew, air, <bc. aflift the tender radicle in nouriftiing the plume, with which they have still a connection by means of the feminal root above described. But, when the radicle or second root has descended deep enough into the earth, and has acquired a sufficient number of filaments or branches for absorbing as much aliment as is proper for the growth of the plume; then the feminal, or diflimilar leaves, their utility being entirely superseded, begin to decay and fall off.

Fig. 8. The appearance of the radicle, plume, and feminal root, when a little further advanced in growth. Having thus briefly described the feed, and traced its evolution into three principal organic parts, viz. the plume, radicle, and feminal leaves, we ffiall next take an anatomical view of the root, trunk, leaves, <bc. L Sect.A G R I C U S e c t. II. Of the Root. In examining the root of plants, the first thing that presents itself is the flcin, which is of various colours in different plants. Every root, after it has arrived at a. certain age, has a double Ikin. The sir st is coeval with the other parts, and exists in the feed: but afterwards there is a ring sent off from the bark, and forms a second'\''lkin; e g. in the root of the dandelion, towards the end of May, the original or outer (kin appears thriveted, and is easily separated from the new one, which is fresher, and adheres more firmly to the bark. Perennial plants are supplied in this manner with a new skin every year; the outer one always falls off in the autumn or winter, and a new one is formed from the bark in the fucceedteg spring. The Ikin has numerous cells or vessels, and is a continuation of. the parenchymatous part of the radicle. However, it does not consist folcly of parenchyma; for the microfc Ope shews that there are many tubular lignous vessels interspersed through it. When the fkm is removed, the true cortical substance or bark appears, which is also a continuation of the parenchymatous part of the radicle, but greatly augmented. The bark is of very different sizes. In molt trees, it is exceeding thin in proportion to the wood and pith. On the other hand,In carrots, it is almost one half of the femidiameter of the root; and, in dandelion, it is nearly twice as thick as the woody part. i. The Bark is composed of two substances ; the pa* renchyma, or pulp, which is the principal part; and a few, '\'' fcoody fibres. The parenchyma is exceedingly porous, and has a great resemblance to a fpunge; for it Ihrivels considerably when dried, and dilates to its former dimensions when infused in water. These pores or vessels are not pervious so as to communicate with each other, but consist of diftindt little cells or bladders, scarcely visible without the afiiftance of the microfcope. In all roots, these cells are constantly filled with a thin watery liquor. They are generally of a spherical figure; though in some roots, as die bugloss and dandelion, they are oblong. In many roots, as the horseraddilh, peony, afparagus, potatoe, <fac, the parenchyma is of one uniform ftrufture. But in others it is more diversified, and puts on the shape of rays running from the centre towards the circumference of the bark. These rays sometimes run quite through the bark, as in loyage ; and Ibiwetimes advance towards the middle of it, as in melilot and most of the Leguminous and umbelliferous plants. These rays generally stand at an equal distance from each other in the same plant; but the distance'\'' varies greatly in different plants. Neither are t hey of equal sizes : In carrot they are exceedingly small, and scarcely discernible ; in melilot and cherval, they aie thicker. They are likewise more numerous in some plants than in'\'' others. Sometimes they are ofthe same thjekness from one edge of the bark to the other; and fonie grow wiser as they approach towards the Ikin. Thn vessels with which these rays are amply furnilhed, are supposed to be airvessels, because they are always found to be dry, and not so transparent as the vessels which evidcntly contain the lap. L T U R E.‘ In all roots, there are lignous vessels dilperfed in different proportions through the parenchyma of the bark. These lignous vefiels run longitudinally through the bark in the form of small threads, which are tubular, as is evident from the rising of the sap in them when a root is cut tranfverfely. These lignous sapvessels do not run in dired lines through the bark, but, at small distances, incline towards one another in fiich a manner, that they appear to the naked eye to be inofculated; but the microfcope difeovers them to be only contiguous, and braced together by the parenchyma. These braces or coardations are very various both in size and number in differentroots; but in all plants tliey are most numerous towards the inner edge of the bark. Neither are these vessels Angle tubes, but, like the nerves in animals, are bundles of twenty or thirty small contiguous cylindrical tubes, which , uniformly run from the extremity, of the root, without sending off any branches, or suffering any change in their size or ftiape. In some roots, as parfnip, especially in the ring next, the inner extremity of the bark, these vefiels contain a kind of lymph, which is sweeter than the sap contained in the bladders of the parenchyma. From this circumstance they have got the name of lymphdufis. These lymphduds sometimes yield a mucilaginous, lymph, as in the comphrey; and sometimes a white milky glutinous lymph, as in the angelica, fonchus, burdock, fcorzonera, dandelion, ere. The lymphduds are supposed to be the veflels from which the gums and balfams are fecerned. The lymph of fennil, when exposed to the air, turns into a clear transparent balsam; and that of the fcorzonera, dandelion, <bc. condenses into a gum. The situation of the vessels is various. In some plants,’ they stand in a ring or circle at the inner edge of the bark, as in afparagus ; in others, they appear in lines, or rays, as in berage; in the parfnip, and several other plants, they are most conspicuous toward the outer edge of the bark; and in the dandelion, they are disposed in the form of concentric circles. 2. The Wood of roots is that part which appears after the bark is taken off, and is firmer and less porous than the bark or pith. It consists of two diftind substances, viz. the pulpy, or parenchymatous, and the lignous. The wood is conneded to the bark by la Vge portions of the bark inferred into it. These infertions are mostly in the form of rays, tending to the centre of the pith,, which are easily discernible by the eye in a transverse fedion of most roots. These infertions, like the bark, consist of many vessels, mostly of a round or, oval figure. , The lignous vessels are generally disposed in collateralrows running longitudinally through the root. Some of these contain air, and others sap. The a:rvessels are lo called, because they contain.no liquor. 7’^tfe airvessels are diftinguiftied by being whiter than the others. 3. The Pith is the centrical part of the root. Some roots have no pith, as the ftramonium, nicotiana, others have little or none at the extremities of the roots, but have a considerable quantity of it near the top. The pith, like every other part of a plant, is derived fromfrom the feed: But in feme it is more immediately deiived from the bark. For the infertions of the bark running in betwixt the rays of the wood, meet in the centre, and conilitute the pith. It is owing to this circumstance, that among roots which have no pith in their lower parts, they are amply provided with it towards the top, as in columbine, lovage, 6v, The bladders of the pith are of very different sizes, and generally of a circular figure. Their position is_ more uniform than in the bark. Their sides are not mere films, but a composition of small fibres or threads ; which gives the pith, when viewed with a microfcope, the appearance of a piece of fine gauze, or network. We shall conclude the description of roots, with observing, that their whole substance is nothing but a congeries of tubes and fibres, adapted by nature for the abferption.of nourishment, and of course the extension and augmentation of their parts.

E E E E, The rays of the wood, in which the holes are the airvessels. N. B. This root has no pith. Sect. III. Of the Trunks Stalk, or Stem. In deferibing the trunks of plants, it is necessary to prerqife, that whatever is saidwith regard to them, applies equally to the branches, The trunk, like the root, consists of three parts, viz. the bark, wood, and pith. These parts, though substantially the ^same in the trunk as in the root, are in many.cases very different in their texture and appearance. '\'' r . The skin of the bark is composed of very minute bladders, incerfperfed with longitudinal woody fibres, as in the nettle, thiille, and most herbs. The outside of the skin is visibly porous in feme plants, particularly the cane. The principal body of the bark is composed of pulp or parenchyma, and innumerable vessels much larger than those of the skin. The texture of the pulpy part, tho’ the same substance with the parenchyma in roots, yet seldom appears in the form of rays running towards the pith ; and when these rays do appear, they do not extend above half way to the circumference. The veffeis. gf the bark are very differently situated, and destined for various purposes in different.plants. For example, in the bark of the Pine, the inmost are lymphdufts, and exceedingly small; the outmofl are gum or refinifc rods vessels, destined for the fecretion of turpentine ; and are se large, as to be diflindly visible to the naked eye. 2. The Wood lies betwixt the bark and pith, and confifls of two parts, viz. a parenchymatous, and lignous. In all trees, the parenchymatous part of the wood, though much diversified as to size and confidence, is uniformly disposed in diametrical rays, or infertions running betwixt similar rays of the lignous part. The true wood is nothing but a congeries of old dried lymphdudts. Between the bark and the wood a new ring of these dudts is formed every year, which gradually looies its softness as the cold feafbn approaches, and, towards the middle of winter,'\'' is condensed into a felid ring of wood, These annual rings, which are diftindtly visible in most trees when cut through, serve as natural marks to distinguish their age. Plate V. fig. 1, 2. The rings of one year are femetimes larger, sometimes fess, than thofeof another, probably owing to the favourableness or unfavourableness of the season. 3. The Pith, though of a different texture, is exactly of the same substance with the parenchyma of the bark, and the infertions of the wood. The quantity of pith is various in different plants. Instead of being increased every year like the wood, it is annually diminiihed, its vessels drying up, and assuming the appearance, and ftrudture of wood; in so much that in old trees there is searce such a thing as pith to be discerned. A ring of sapvessels ape usually placed at the outer, edge of the pith, next the wood. In the pine, fig, and walnut, they are very large. The parenchyma of the pith, is composed of small cells or bladders, of the same, kind with those of the bark, only of a larger size. The general figure of these biadders is circular; though in feme plants, as the thistle, and borage, they are angular.. Though the pith is originally one connedted chain of bladders ; yet as the plant grows old, they ftrrivel, and open in different diredions. In the walnut, after a certain age, it appears in the form of a regular tranfverfehollow division. In feme plants, it is altogether wanting ; in others, as the fenchus, nettle, fyc. there is only a transverse partition of it at every joint. Many other varieties might be mentioned ; • but thesemust be left to the cbfervation of the reader,.'\'' . Plate V. Fig. 1. A transverse fedtion of . a branch of ash, as it appears to the eye.Fig. 2.

For example, mezereon generally flowers in January; but these flowers were completely formed in the month of August preceeding. Of this fast any one may satisfy himself by separating the coats of a tulip root about the beginning of September; and he will find that the two innermost form a kind of cell, in the centre of which (lands the young flower, which is not to make its appearance till the following April or May. Sect. IV. Of the Leaves. The leaves of plants consist of the same substance with that of the trunk. They are full of nerves, or woody po/tions, running in all directions, and branching «ut into innumerable small threads, interwoven with the Parenchyma like fine lace or gauze. The (kin of the leaf, like that of an animal, is full of pores, which both serve for perspiration, and for the absorption of dews, air, fcc. These pores, or orifices, differ both in (hape and magnitude in different plants, which is the cause of that variety of texture or grain peculiar to every plant. The pulpy or parenchymatous part, corififts of very minute fibres, wound up into small cells'\'' or bladders. These cells are of various sizes in the same leaf. All leaves, of whatever figure, have a marginal fibre, by which all the rest are bounded. The particular (hape of this fibre determines the figure of the leaf. The vessels of leaves have the appearance of inofcula,ting; but, when examined by the microfcppe, they are found only to be interwoven, or laid along each other. What is called airvessels, or those which carry no sap, are visible even to the naked eye in some leaves. When a leaf is (lowly broke, they appear like small woolly fibres, connected to both ends of the broken piece. Plate VI. Fig. 1. The appearance of the airvessels to the eye, in a vine leaf drawn gently asunder. Fig 2. A small piece cut off that leaf. Fig. 3. The same piece magnified, in which the vessels have the appearance of a screw. Fig. 4. The appearance of these vessels as they exist in the leaf before they are stretched out. Sect. V. Of the Flower. It is needless here to mention any thing of the texture, or of the vessels, ire. of flowers, as they are pretty similar to those of the leaf. It would also be foreign to our present purpose, to take any notice of the characters and diftindtions of flowers. These belong to .the science of Botany, to which the reader is referred. There is one curious sad, however, which must not be omitted, viz. That every flower is perfe&ly formed in all its parts many months before it appears outwardly ; that is, the flowers which appear this year, are not, pro Plate VI. Fig.;. Exhibits a view of the tuliproot when diffe Cled in September, with the young flower toward* the bottom. S E c T. VI. Of the Fruit. In deferibing the ftrudure of fruits, a few examples (hall be taken from such as are mod generally known. 1. A Pear, besides the (kin, which is a production of the (kin of the bark, consists of a double parenchyma or pulp, sap, and airvessels, calculary, and acetary. The outer parenchyma is the same substance continued from the bark, only its bladders are larger and more fucculent. It is every where interspersed with small globules or grains, and the bladders refpe Cl these grains as a kind of centres, every grain being the centre of a number of bladders. The sap and airvessels in this pulp are extremely small. Next the core is the inner pulp or parenchyma, which consists of bladders of the same kind with the outer, only larger and more oblong, cprrefponding to those of the pulp, from which it seems to be ^derived. This inner pulp is much fourer than the other, and has none of the small grains interspersed through it; and hence.it has got the name of acetary. Between the acetary a^nd outer pulp, the globules or grains begin to grow larger, and gradually unite into a hard stony body, especially towards the corculum, or (tool of the fruit; and from this circumstance it has been called the calculary. These grains are not derived from any of the organical parts of the tree, but seem rather to be a kind of concretions precipitated from the sap, similar to the precipitations from wine, urine, and othei liquors. The core is a roundiflt cavity in the centre of the pear, lined with a hard woody membrane, in which the feed is inclofed. At the bottom of the core there is a small du Ct or canal, which runs up to the top of the pear; this canal allows the air *0 get into the core, for the purpose of drying and ripening the feeds.

A, The channel, or du<5t, which runs from the top of the pear to the bottom of the core. 2. In a Lemon, the parenchyma appears in thr.ee different forms. The parenchyma of the rind is of a coarse texture, being composed of thick fibres, woven into large bladders. Those neared the surface contain the essential oil of the fruit, which burlls into a flame when the Ikin is squeezed over a candle. From this outmod parenchyma nine or ten infertions or lamellae are produced, which run between as many portions of the pulp, and unite into one body in the centre of the fruit, which corresponds to the pith in trunks or roots. At the bottom and top of the lemon, this pith evidently joins with the rind, without the intervention of any lamellae. This circumstance (hows, that the pith and bark are actually conneftedin the trunkand roots of plants, though it is difficult to demondrate the connexion, on account of the closeness of their texture, and the minuteness of their fibres. Many vessels are dispersed through the whole of this parenchyma; but the larged ones dand on the inner edge of the rind, and the outer edge of the pith, jud at the two extremities of each lamella. The second kind of parenchyma is placed between the rind and the pith, is divided into didimft bodies by the lamellae ; and each of these bodies forms a large bag. These bags contain a third parenchyma, which is a cluder of smaller bags, didinft and unconnedted with each other, having a small dalk by which they are fixed to the large bag. Within each of these small bags are many hundreds of bladders, composed of extremely minute fibres. These bladders contain the acid juice of the lemon. From this fliort sketch of the drudhire and composition of vegetables, both the farmer and .philosopher may draw very useful and important conclusions. Some of them will perhaps be taken notice of in the course of this treatise. Plate V. Fig. 3. A longitudinal fedtion of a le'\'' . mbn.

Of the nature and motion of the Sap. The vessels in the roots of plants absorb moiflure from the earth, and convey st to the trunk, branches, leaves, &c. This juice, when it first. enters into the root, is crude ; but as it ascends into the other parts of the plant, it undergoes several changes, by means of the different configurations of the veflels peculiar to each part. Thus the leaves, flowers, fruit, and feed, have all something peculiar in the ftrudlure and arrangement of their veffds, vjhich produces considerable changes in the nature of the sap. It is not known how these changes are produced: but how the flomachs of animals make chyle from animal and vegetable substances, or how urine, faliva, bile, <bc. is secreted from the common mass of blood, is a S little known. The sap likewise moves in a lateral or horizontal diredtion. Philosophers are greatly divided about what they call the circulation of the sap. Some contend, that it returns to the root betwixt the bark and wood. But Hales, who has made many accurate experiments on the fubjedt, has fliown, that it does not circulate, but ascends and descends in the same vessels; that it ascends in hot weather, and descends in cold, like the spirits in a thermometer. Vegetables begin to absorb sap about the beginning of Spring, and soon after Ihoot out their buds, leaves, and flowers. When plants are in a (late of vegetation, especially in hot weather, there is a great deal of superfluous sap absorbed; but the superfluous parts are carried off by tranfpiration. Every part of a plant transpires; but the greatest quantity passes by the leaves. Some have afligned the tranfpiration of plants, as the cause of the motion of the sap. It is undoubtedly one cause of this motion; because, if the tranfpiration be '\'' flopped, at a time when all the vessels are full, the motion of the sap me st flop of course. But then there is a previous and principal cause, viz. that power in the vef M fels.fels, whatever it i&, that first puts the Tap in motion, before any tranfpiration has commenced. Heat, moisture, and air, are the three chief circumstances that promote the ascent of the sap. Hence nothing is more favourable to vegetation than warm Weather accompanied with rain: on the other hand, cold dry weather is its greatest enemy. In a wet, cold season, every thing rots; and in hot dry weather every thing is parched. But the circumstances most favourable to vegetation are cloudy, hot weather, inclinable to thunder, Succeeded by plentiful rains. Sect. VIII. Of the Food of Plants. It is thought to be an important question in agriculture, whether the several kinds of plants require the same, or different nourishment. Upon a superficial view of this question, it would appear very improbable, that the same matter could nourish such a variety of plants, differing so essentially in smell, taste, figure, <&c. Much, however, may depend upon the internal ftrudlure and arrangement of the vessels. One thing is certain, that if the vessels in any plant be uncommonly small, parts will be reje&ed by that plant which would be absorbed by one whose vessels are larger. Nay, changes may be made in the crude homogeneous nourishment, by a small difference, in the figure or action of the vessels. It is given out as a fadt, by writers on this fubjedt, that one plant will starve another, by robbing it of its nourishment. This does not seem to affedt either side of the question; for it may starve its neighbour, either by extending its roots, and requiring a greater quantity of nourishment than the other; or it may absorb the peculiar food which is necessary for the growth of the other plant. In either case, the plant is deprived of a proper quantity of nourishment. It is likewise proposed as a difficulty, Why a poisonous plant and its antidote will grow in the same soil, and very near each others This argument is of the same nature With the former. It may be owing either to these plants imbibing different juices from the earth, or to peculiarities in the ftrudlure and adtion of their vefTeJs. These, and many other ambiguous fadls, ( have been advanced on both sides of this question, which we shall not spend time iii enumerating. The argument drawn from grafted plants, seems more diredl and decisive. A stalk of a lemon, grafted on a branch of an orangetree, grew, ripened its fruit, and preserved the figure and all the other qualities belonging to a lemon. This plainly indicates, that the organisation of the lemon had given a different modification to the juices of the orange, through the intervention of which it received its nourishment. It is also certain, that the different parts of the same L T U R E. plant have frequently various smells, tastes, <bc. although the nourilhment derived from the root must be the same. This is an evidence, that the different ftiud Uire of parrs in the same plants is capable of producing very sensible changes in the nature and quality of the sap. Repeated experiments show, .that many plants of very opposite qualities, and even trees, have been nourished and brougjht tq maturity by the purest water alone. It is observed, op the other hand, that different plants require different foils.. This is certainly true: But what then ? Does not this difference in soil rather depend upon the greater or lesser quantity, than any peculiar quality in the food ? Thyme grows hest in a dry soil; but it will grow equally well in earth carried from a marsh to the top of a mountain. The roots of plants are fitted to absorb every fluid that comes within their reach. They have been found by experiment to imbibe fluids that actually poison them. From this circumstance it may be fairly concluded, that they have not, like animals, the sagacity of chufing the food that is most proper for nourishing them, and rejecting that which is either hoxious or less nourifiiing. Mr Dickion, author of an excellent treatise on agriculture, publi/hed in 1765, has endeavoured to six the particular ingredients that enter into the composition of the food of vegetables. He contends, that neither earth, water, air, oil, nor fait, can be called the food of plants ; '\'' but he thinks that it consists of a combination of all these substances. His arguments in support of this theory are chiefly drawn from the chemical analysis, which Ihows, •that all these substances may be extorted from vegetables by the force of fire; and from a consideration that a due admixture of .these .substances (or such things as contain them) is favourable, and even necessary, to vegetation. His last argument is good : But whoever attempts to discover the properties of plants, or the ingredients of their food, from a chemical analysis, will probably never do much service to the science of agriculture. Fire and a retort is capable of torturing either animals or vegetables into forms and qualities which never existed either in theft bodies, or in their food. We shall conclude this fedtion with observing, that the farmer, in nourishing his plants, should be direfted entirely by experience. If he knows, that putrid animal and vegetable substances, that lime, foot, marie, foe. when applied with judgment, aflift the growth of his plants, and augment his crop, it is of little consequence whether he be acquainted with their chemical analysis, or the particular mode of their operation. We do not mean that he should continue obstinately in the old beaten track, as it is called ; but rathe/r that he should try whether he can by any means improve upon the old method, and that his pra&ice should be diredted according to the success of theft trials. PARTPART II. Of the various Operations upon the Soil, in order to prepare it for the Recsp'\'' tion and Nourijhment of Plants. S e c t. I. Of Manures. TG'Very substance which promotes the growth of plants ■* * is denominated a manure. As to the operation of manures, some maintain, that they give to the earth an additional quantity of the vegetable food; others, that they are of no other use than to divide the soil, and therefore that tillage may be substituted’in their place. This lafl opinion was embraced by Mr Tull, and is the fundamental principle in his horsehoeing hulbandry. A minute divilion of the soil will da. a great deal; but the experience of all ages shows that it will do much more by the addition of manure. In Scotland, it is the universal practice to dung lands, that are in constant tillage, at leal! once'\'' in five years ; and it eonfifts with observation, that the ground is considerably enriched the sir st year, but that the crops gradually decline till the virtues of the dung are entirely exhausted. Some manures lose their virtue by being long exposed to the air. If dung be kept after it is sufficiently rotted, the most valuable part of it will evaporate. Others, as lime and marks, are of an opposite nature: the longer they are exposed to the air, their utility to the land is improved, fftom this circumstance it is probable, that marks and lime attra A something from the air which ren. ders them more favourable to vegetation. There is a great variety of substances which, when laid upon land, adl as manures. But the most usual manures in this country are dung, lime, marks, ashes, foot, seaweed, shells, tic. Of Dung. Dung is properly the excrement of animals ; but what commonly goes by that name, is a mixture of excre■ ments, putrefied vegetable and animal substances. If dunghills be kept after they are sufficiently rotted, the oily and more volatile parts, which are the best ingredients, fly off. They should likewise be placed in a dry situation, and raised high at the sides, to prevent these parts from being carried off by water ; for much u r ater prevents the uniform putrefasftion of dunghills of this mixed kind. To promote a proper putrefadlion, the dung should not be laid in small heaps, but spread thick upon the dunghill ; for by this means the fermentation commences sooner, the natural sap is preserved, and the dung is prevented from being burnt, or f.refanged, as it is termed by farmers. Dung, when burnt in this manner, is dry, white, and ufekfs as a manure. It is agreed, that dunghills ought to be covered, to prevent the exhalation of vegetable food. But the difficulty is, how to execute it. Some propose a thin layer of earth for this purpose; others, that a pit should be dug, built with flags at the side, and covered with a roof. The former would answer very well, were it not for the additions that are constantly making to dunghills; and the latter is so expensive, that few people will chuse to make trial of it. When dung comes from the liable or byre, it is mixed with straw; which abforbs the moisture, and prevents it from exhaling till the straw itself putrefies. When in this situation, if it be laid thick upon the top of the dunghill, there being but a small surface exposed to the air, the juices will be tolerably well preserved. As dung thus loses its best qualities by being exposed to the sun and weather, it ought to be plowed in as soon as poflibk, after being laid upon land. If sufficiently putrefied, it ffiould be plowed in with a shallow furrow, as its juices are waffied down by the rain : It should likewise be spread very equally; for when large pieces lie scattered up and down, they become a nidus to infedts ■ and vermin. Of Lime. Lime being of an alkaline nature, attra&s acids: Hence it is supposed to communicate to the soil a power of attrad Hng the vegetable food from the air. Lime is a heavy substance, and penetrates deep into the soil; it sometimes even '\'' sinks below the reach of the plow. By fermenting with acids, it breaks down and divides the soil into small particles, and makes it soft, mellow^ and evidently in a state of fermentation. It likewise dissolves oils, and all animal and vegetable substances, and converts them into vegetable food. This quality ren*. ders it peculiarly useful in deftroyirg rootweeds. These being the general properties of lime, it is supposed to have a twofold operation upon land. When a large quantity is used, especially after being long exposed to the air, it promotes vegetation by giving a kind of stimulus to the soil, and making it exert itself. This, operation of lime is not merely hypothetical; for experience shews, that land thoroughly limed may be reduced to a poorer condition by cropping, than if it had nor been limed at all. It is even poffibk to reduce limed land to a caput mortuum; and the more frequently and the better the land is plowed, it is the sooner reduced to this state. Lime also enriches land, by augmenting the vegetable aliment. When intended for this purpcfe, only a fmail quantity fhonld be employed; as a small quantity of hme is fuftkient to impregnate a large quantity of earth,andto communicate to It as high a degree of an absorbing quality as it is capable of receiving. These different operations of lime is confirmed by experience, and agreeable to the pfa&ice in those parts of Scotland where lime is most used. When employed for the purpose of improving barren lands, it is laid on in large quantities, to give a flimulus to the soil, and make it exert all its vigour; and when applied to land already improved, it is used in small quantities, and repeated once every third or fourth year, to prevent too great an exertion, and impoveriiliing the land, by exhausting too much of the vegetable food. The lands in Scotland capable of the greatefi: improvement by lime, are the outfield and muir lands. The outfield land is generally kept three years in tillage, and carries three crops of oats ; it is then allowed to rest six years, and after that is brought again into tillage. This method of cultivating outfield land is found, by calculation, to be sufficiently able to bear the expence, and allow a reasonable profit to the farmer, besides the improvement the lands derive from the lime. Is England, lime is sometimes used as a top dressing for wheat. The method is this: They sow their wheat without laying on any manure ; and in the beginning of February, for every acre of land, they take 20 bulhels of unflaked lime, and 4 bushels of sand, or brickrubbilh. Towards the end of the month, the lime is flaked and mixed with the sand: In the last week of the month, this is scattered by way of topdrefling over the green wheat; and as rain generally succeeds, it is soon waflied down to the roots of the plant, and gives them a vigour and strength of grov/yh that is astonishing to people who have never seen this method pradfifed. But, if the weather inclines to be dry, the quantity of sand must be doubled, to prevent the plants from being burnt by the corrosive quality of the lime. The general characters by which marie is best diftinguilhed, are these : It attracts and ferments with acids, and does not bake in the fire like potter’s earth, which diftinguiflies it sufficiently from clay; upon being exposed for some time to the air and weather, it diflblves like qmcklime, and falls intp a fine powder; when dry, it is friable and undtuous like leadore ; when wet, it is soft and slippery to the touch; whereas virginearth is rough and gritty. There are a great variety of marks ; but they are generally reduced to three kinds: The clay, the stone, and the shell marie. The clay and stone marks are nearly of the same nature ; but the fliellmaile differs from both. Of Clay and Stone Maries. Though plants will not grow in these marks, when pure; yet, when mixed with soil, they become an excel Stone and clay marks are possessed of much the same qualities with lime, anfl consequently aft nearly in the L T U R E. same manner upon the soil. They communicate to the soil a power of attradling the vegetable food from the air, diflblve the vegetable food, and prepare it for entering the roots of plants. They likewise attradt oils so strongly, that they are frequently used for extracting greasy spots out of cloth; they are therefore supposed to attract oil from the air and earth, which is the chief ingredient in the nourishment of plants. Both the clay and stone marks are long of dissolving. Large pieces of the stonemark are sometimes found undifiblved many years after'\''it has been laid on the land This renders it necessary to lay on a large quantity o. them, left their effedts Ihould not at first appear. As mark may ‘be used with safety in greater quantity than lime, it must communicate to the soil a stronger power of attracting the vegetable food, and consequently it ought always to be preferred. Mark is likewise preferable to lime in this refpedt, that it is longer of dissolving; and therefore the land will continue to carry better crops for several years longer after it has been marled. However, if the soil be soft and fpungy, the mark, like lime, will sink below the reach of the plough, and prevent those advantages which might naturally be expecced Though marie is preferable to lime as a manure; yet it must be considered, that their operation upon the earth is the same; consequently, when markd land has been exhausted with crops, it cannot receive much benefit from an immediate application of mark a second time; for the same reason, it can receive as little advantage from lime : Dung therefore, as it contains a great proportion of the vegetable food, which lime and marks diminish, is the most proper manure for markd or limed lands exhausted with crops. What was said with regard to the application of lime, in smaller or larger quantities, to barren lands and lands in good o^'\''er, may be said with equal propriety with regard to stone and clay marks. This mark is of a different nature from the stone and clay marks. It does not dissolve with water, but abforbs and swells with it like .a fpunge: It attracts acids more forcibly. But the principal difference betwixt the (hellmark and the other marks consists in this, that the (hellmark contains a great quantity of oil. .This mark is therefore luppofed to promote vegetation, by increasing the food of plants, by communicating to the soil a power of attracting this food from the air, by dividing the soil into small particles, and by preparing the vegetable food for being absorbed by their roots. As (hellmark does not exhaust land like lime and the other marks, it may be repeated as often as the husbandman pleases. Its effects are likewise more sudden. The ashes of vegetables contain a large quantity of alkaline fait: Hence they attra Ct acids more strongly than any other substances.49 A G R I C U L The operation of alhes upon the soil must therefore be of the same nature with that of lime, only it is more violent and fuddea, and consequently it is sooner over. This is confirmed by experience. After land has been manured with alhes, the firll crop is commonly very luxuriant; but a second crop almost entirely, exhaulis the land. Hence alhes Ihould be laid on in small .quantities, and Ihould not be applied to land exhaulted by lime or marie; neither Ihould they be repeated, or followed by these manures. Burnt turf is generally recommended as a manure. Turfs are chiefly composed of vegetables ; their alhes, therefore, mull; be of the same nature with those of wood or any other vegetable fubltance. It is found by experience, that the burning of turfs turns out to advantage in proportion to the number of roots they contain; and therefore land, with a tough sward of grals, is m st proper to be improved in this manner. In burning turf, the heaps mull be Covered in such a manner as to prevent the flame from breaking out; otherwise the most useful part of the alhes will fly off. To prevent burnt land from being exhausted, one or two crops only Ihould be. taken, and then the land ought to be laid out in grass. Its fertility will be greatly increased, if a little dung be added after the first crop. Of Soot. Soo r contains oil, fait, and earth. It promotes vegetation in the same manner as dung or Ihellmarle. Soot is generally applied in the Spring as a topdrefling to winter corn or grass. The effects of foot used in this way are so sudden, that they evidently appear after the first rain. But its virtues are commonly exhausted by a single crop. However, when the effefts of foot are over, the soil is not exhausted, as by allies or lime;.it may therefore be repeated as often as the farmer thinks proper ; or it may be followed with advantage by alhes, lime, or marie. Of Seaweed. All plants that grow upon rocks, within reach of the sea, are good manures. These are frequently loosened and driven alhore by the tide. They are of a soft pulpy nature, and soon putrefy. Seaweeds promote vegetation in the same manner as dung or foot; but their effects are not so lasting as dung. However, they are preferable to dung in this refpeft, that they do not produce so many weeds. They may be applied to land in any situation, and are peculiarly proper for land that is exhausted by lime or alhes. When their effects cease, the land is not injured, and any kind of manure may bp used after them. The oftener seaweeds are applied, the land becomes the richer. This is confirmed by experience. The lands npar the Ihores, where the weeds have been long used as manures, are among the richest in Scotland, and have been kept almost constantly in tillage. Vol. I. No. 3. 3 Of Shells. Beds of Ihe Jls are to he met with in many places, but particularly near the sealhore. These Ihells ferment with acids, and, like other animalsubstances, contain oil, fait, and earth. Their operation is supposed to be of the same kind with that of Ihellroarle : But, as they take a long time to dilfolve, their effefts must be flower and weaker: They ought therefore to be applied in large quantities, otherwise their operation will be hardly perceptible. Shells exhaust the land, but not near so much as lime or ashes; it is therefore improper to use them immediately after these manures. When Ihells are found below the surface of the ground, as they generally are, they Ihould be exposed to the air for feme time before they are ploughed in: This not only aflifts their fermentation, but promotes their putrefaction. Of Vegetables in an entire State, or sown for Manure. It is a practice in many places, particularly in England, to few turnip, pease, buckwheat, <&c. and to plough them down for manuring the land. This practice is thought by feme people to be attended with no advantage; because the plants, when ploughed down, can convey no more food to the soil than they take from it. But it ought to be considered, that feme of the plants employed in this manner pufti their roots below the reach of the plough, and suck up the food to the surface; the feed that is sown likewise contains a greatproportion of vegetable food; besides what the plants, when growing, may derive from the air, <fyc. Froot these circumstances it may be inferred, that they actually return more nourifliment to the soil than they extra Ct from it. The covering of the surface is also an advantage : Every farmer knows, that when the soil has been covered for a considerable time by a strong crop of pease, or any other corn laid down, the soil, though naturally hard and stiff, becomes soft, mellow, and free. Of Water. Rainwater contains a considerable quantity of vegetable food. When it falls upon land that has a defeent, by running off, it must carry along with it feme of the finest particles of the soil and the vegetable food contained in them. If this water, then, is let in upon a field, and allowed to settle, the land will receive from it not only the vegetable food contained in the water itself, but likewise what is contained in the particles of earth carried off from the higher grounds. This method of manuring can only be used in fields which lie on the sides of rivers, or such as can be easily drained. In practising it, the water must not be allowed to run off violently, otherwise it does more hurt than good. Land in grass is most proper for this kind of N manuring.manuring. The firmness of the surface prevents any of • the soil from being carried off when the water is draining, and the grass intangles the mud, <&c. and hinders them from going along with the water. This operation Ihould be performed in the spring. In that season grasslands suffer lead from being •oversowed. Sect. Ill, Of Soils with respect to Manures. Soils are very different in their natures, and composed of Very different ingredients: Some foils contain more, and others less, of the food necefl Vny for the nouriihment of plants. It is neceflary to inquire into these differences, in order to difcoyer what manures are most proper for each kind. The foils most common in Scotland are the black loamy, the clay, the sandy, and the mossy. Of these there are many varieties, according to the different proportions of that particular kind of earth from which they are denominated. Some foils are even so blended, that it is difficult to determine what kind of earth most prevails in them. Of the black Loamy Soil. Pure loam seems to be nothing else but the earth of putrefied vegetables, accumulated by the successive decay of natural or artificial crops. In cultivated lands, dung and other manure greatly increase the quantity of the loam. The principal qualities of loam are these : When allowed to rest, it acquires a degree of cohefion, but never becomes so hard and tough as clay: When turned up and exposed to the air, it becomes free and open, and easily crumbles down : When, dry, it readily admits water, and swells and retains it like Ihellmarle; however, it only retains a proper quantity, and allows the rest to run off. It also contains oil, fermentswith acids, and is of an abforbent nature. There is no soil altogether pure; but that soil which has loam in its composition ..possesses in feme degree all the qualities of loam; and these qualities are unquestionably the most proper for nourishing plants. Its oils and salts afford food to the plants ; the abforbent quality of which it is possessed, also attrads vegetable food from the air; its friableness, aad fermenting with '\'' acids, give an easy passage to. the roots to acquire this food. Experience, the only fare guide in fubje<fts of this kind, shows that a loamy soil is inoft fruitful. Some lolls, when well limed or dunged, may bear as great crops as the loamy soil; but then they require a supply inuch sooner.. The loamy soil has likewise another advantage pver every o^her : It does not suffer so much from drought or rain, as clay and sandy foils. All land called infield land has a certain quantity of loam in. its composition, probably owing to the dung ‘ L T U R E. which is laid from time to time upon it. This is the only diftinfiion betwixt outfield and infield land. The soil which contains a great proportion of loam, requires very little manure. It may be kept coriftantly in good heart by proper tillage and good management. The common loarny soil ‘requires manure, and no kind of manurh is improper for it; dung, however, is unquestionably the hest. Lime, unless managed with care, is in danger of hurting a loamy soil by exhausting it. Of the ClaySoil. The richest kind of claysoil is that which consists of clay and loam. To discover the nature of this soil, it is necelfafy to know the qualities of clay. Clay is a very solid body, and its parts adhere firmly together: It does not easily admit water, but is capable of containing a great quantify, swells but little, and does not easily part with it. When dry. Clayis very hard, and becomes the harder the more suddenly it is dried. In the process of drying, it contracts unequally, and breaks out into rents or fiflures where the cohefion is weakest. It ferments v/ith acids, but has no oil in its composition. From £ flight view of these qualities it appears, that a claysoil is not so well adapted for the nouriftiment of plants as the loamy: it is more fubjedt to receive injuries from drought or rain. In a rainy season, as it is averse to part with the water after it once admits it, the roots of plants will be much weakened or destroyed by being long soaked in the water. On the other hand, in a very (jry season, it becomes so hard, that the roots cannot penetrate deep enough to search for food. These observations are fully confirmed by experience. For it is well known to the husbandman, that the produce of clayfoils are extremely uncertain, as they are liable to be destroyed by dry or wet seasons. These foils labour under another disadvantage; as they repel water, especially when it falls in small quantities, they reap no benefit from dews or flight {bowers. The claysoil is said to contain vegetable food, but does not allow it to be easily dissolved: and hence lime, marks, or aflies, are the most proper manures for it, as they divide it into small particles. . These manures likewise communicate to it a greater power of absorption ; and therefore they will enable it both to receive andtranfmit water more readily, and of course make it less subject to be injured by the weather. Clayfoils, when mixed with loam, are very rich ; but, when mixed with sand or till, they are very poor. Poor clayfoils require such manures as contain the greatest quantity of vegetable food; therefore dung, shellmarle, seaweed, 6c. are the belt manures for them. Of the Sandy Soil. There are two kinds of sand that enter into the composition of foils; .the one consists of small particles of flint, the other of broken sir ells. TheSi A G R I C U 1 The sandyfsll which is composed of flinty particles, '\'' easily receivesand tranfmits water; and consequently is hot capable of containing a sufficient quantity for promoting the growth of plants: Its particles do not adhere, and is therefore unable to support plants that have few roots and grow high. Belides, it is firfjeptible of greater heat from the sun than any othgr soil, which is apt to pare!*! the plants. As this soil contains no oil, it mult be very defective in vegetable food; and, as it has no abforbent quality, it will receive but a small supply from the air. From the qualities of this soil, the manures moll pro■ per for it are easily difeovered. = Clay will make it firmer, and enable it to retain the water; but clay contains little vegetable food. Dung will supply it with the food of plants; but will not render it firm, or make it retain water, Moss will help it to retain water, and supply it with vegetable food; but will not make it firmer. A mixture of clay and dung, or of clay and moss,. seems therefore to be the most proper manure for this soil. The qualities of a sandy foi,l composed of broken fliclls, arenearly the same with those of the former kind. The only differences are, that it ferments with acids,contains oil, and is capable of being'\'' diflblved. Hence this soil mud have h larger quantity of vegetable food, and must also receive a greater supply from the a ir.~.Aj n^xture ^ dungand clay, or of moss and clay, is likew He the mod proper manure for this soil: But if any fubdance could be found that could reduce the particles of the fliells to a date of puprefaftion, it would be preferable to any thing hitherto known for improving a soil of this kind. Of the Mossy Soil. Moss principally confids either of Jive or at lead uncorrupted vegetables. It mud therefore have fait and oil in its composition. It does not easily putrefy, and prevents other bodies from putrefying. It swells with water like a fpunge, and does not easily part with it. To render the mofly soil sit for nourishing plants, the vegetables in it mull be reduced to a date of putrefa&icn. This will not only supply it with vegetable food, but Jikewife render it firmer, and make it more easily part with water. Hence thole manure'\'' s which ferment mod violently with acids, as the clay and done marles, seem to be the mod proper for this soil. These marles will not only raise a violent fermentation, but fill up the pores, and make the soil more solid. When the moss is deep, or has not a solid bottom, lime is improper, because it will soon penetrate beyond the reach of the plough; but, if it has a solid bottom, lime will answer very well. It is improper to sow upon this soil till the fermentation raised by the manure is completely finilhed; for the violence of the fermentation sometimes throws the feeds, a (id even the roots, out of the ground. Frequent ploughings make the mossy soil run much into weeds; and from this circumdance, the praciice of ploughing it but feidom is found to answer better. Sect. IV. Of the Impediments to Vegetation. ■ i. Weeds, as an Impediment to Vegetation. Every vegetable that grows in afield, different from the particular plant that is intended to be cultivated, may be called a vjeed. Weeds injure the plants we desire to cultivate, by robbing them of part of their nourishment, and by preventing the spreading of their roots. Some weeds, as quickening grass, extend and interweave their roots in such a manner that it is difficult to pulverife the soil by tillage. It is therefore of great importance to the farmer to know how weeds may be dedroyed. Weeds are generally divided into three classes, viz. those that are propagated by the feed ; those that are propagated by the roots; and ffirubs. Of deflroying Weeds that are propagated by Seed. Weeds are very different in their natures. Some, if prevented from vegetating,die in a few years by lying moid in the earth ; others will lie many years in this situation, without losing the power of vegetating. The fird kind may be dedroyed, by turning the land infeded with them into graft Jor five or six years; and both kinds may be rooted out by allowing them to vegetate, and then tearing up the young plants before they begin to flower. In order to promote the vegetation of the weeds that are intended to be dedroyed, the land ought to be well ploughed; if a little dung, or other manure, be applied, the crop of weeds will be increased, and their dedruc. tion will be rendered more general. Several weeds, as the thidle, dandelion, ragweed, ire. . are furniffied with a kind of down, by which they float in the air, and are:carried to great didances by the wind. Farmers ffiould be as careful to root out all weeds of this kind from the roots of hedges, banks of fences, <bc. as from their arable land; for although they may have the appearance of being inoffendve in that situation, they are trarffported from thence in great quantities by the wind into the adjacent fields. There is another great source of weeds, but too little attended to by farmers. It is a general practice, to throw the feeds that are separated from the corn in winnowing upon the dunghill; and by this means they arecarried out with the dung, and again sown upon the land. Of deflroying Weeds that are propagated by the Rost. There are many different kinds of weeds propagated by the roots. Some of them infed land that is in tillage, and others land that is in graft. Thole that infefi: land in tillage may be destroyed by turning it into graft for some years. This is the moff / effectualef Fedual means of rooting out quickengrass, and other rootweeds of the same nature,. If the soil be hard and Hi IF, it is the sooner cleared of weeds by being laid Out in grass; But a soft fpungy soil requires to be in grass six or seven years before the weeds are destroyed. Those weeds that infest lands in grass, are eafiefl destroyed by turning the land into tillage. Neither is it necef Tary to continue it long in this situation ; for the weeds commonly disappear after the first ploughing. But as, in some cases, it may he inconvenient to turn a field infested with weeds from tillage into grass, or from grass into tillage, it ’is necessary to consider whether the same may not be accomplished, without altering the situation of the land. When land is in tillage, the weeds may be destroyed by frequently stirring and turning it over in dry weather; for when the weeds are displaced, the drought prevents them from taking root again. Land cannot be made too fine, nor the surface too smooth, when it is intended to be freed of feedweeds ; because by that the greatest number are brought to vegetate : But, when intended to be freed of rootweeds, the rougher the surface, the weeds are the more easily destroyed; because the drought has the easier access to their roots. If grasslands be infested with weeds, and it is inconvenient to turn them into tillage, the only way of destroying the weeds, is to ait them frequently, or pull them up by the roots. Some lands, after being in grass a few years, are liable to be overrun with fog: In this .case, rolling, by making the surface firmer, will be of great use in destroying the fog. This weed, as well as others, may be destroyed by depriving it of air. This may be done by covering the surface with a crop of pease, potatoes, or other plants that lie thick on the surface. A deep trenching will, in some cases, answer the same intention. 0/'\'' dejlroylng Shrubs, as Furze, Broom, Bramble, &c. i. FURZE. The common method of destroying furze (or whins) is by grubbing them out with a hoe. But it is impoflible to root them out so compleatly as to prevent their springing again, especially if the '\'' land be continued in grass. The most effectual method, therefore., is to bring the land into tillage immediately after the whins have been grubbed up. As long as it continues in tillage, no whins will appear; but if turned into grass, they grow as numerous as ever. To prevent this return of whins, the young plants that appear after the land is turned into grass, should be pulled up by the roots. Unless they are very thick, this is neither troublesome nor expensive : When the ground is moist, it may be performed by young boys. If any of them rise afterwards, which is commonly the case, the lame operation must be repeated every season till the land is compleatly cleared of them. There is another scheme of management which in a L T U R E. few years will effedtually destroy whins. It is certain that the feeds of whins will not vegetate unless they are allowed to lie in the earth undisturbed for a considerable time. As long as land is left in tillage, although there be many whinfeeds in it, yet they never vegetate. Whinplants do not even appear till two years after the land has been allowed to rest, or has been turned into grass. Now, if a scheme of management be fallowed, by which the land is turned from tillage into grass, and from grass into tillage, the whins by degrees will be wholly eradicated. It was observed above, that before lands infested with whins can be improved, the whins must be grubbed up. This operation is both tedious and expensive. The following method of rooting them out by the plough is more expeditious, Ids expensive, and has been tried with success. This work must be performed by a strong Scotch plough, with a well redd beam. As it requires great force to tear up the roots, six horses ihould be yoked in pairs. Two drivers are likewise neceflary, to prevent the horses from stepping aside. As the whins in rising are apt to entangle or choke the beam, another man is also neceflary to pulh them off with a pitchfork. A plough yoked and attended in this manner, will plow down whins near three feet high, with roots above four feet long, and an inch in diameter. This operation ftiould be performed in the winter, when the land is well soaked with rain. After the land has been ploughed in this manner, it Ihould be allowed to lie till summer, wdien the whins torn up by the plough may be burned, the land harrowed, and the roots gathered. Afterwards the land may be drefled according to the judgment of the farmer; only the second ploughing ftiould be across, that any roots which have been left may be torn up. But when the whins are so strong that it is impoflible to plough them down, they may be burned ; and if the land be allowed to lie a few years after, it may be ploughed without much difficulty. 2. BROOM. Broom is not so bushy, and does not cover the surface so much as whins; and therefore land infested with it is more easily cleared. Though the methods recommended for destroying whins will mod effeftually destroy broom, a more Ample and less expensive one will sufficiently answer the purpose. If broom, especially When it is old, be cut so low as to take away all the leaves, it will never spring again, A kind of scythe has lately been invented, by which broom may be cut in this manner with great expedition. If this method be observed, it is unneceflary to bring land from grass into tillage in order to clear it of broom. 3. BRAMBLE. Thi s plant is of a very different nature from whin or broom. The root sinks deep into the earth, and spreads very wide. Though cut in the winter, it rises and comes to such perfection as to carry fruit in the summer. ItIt is therefore a difficult matter to clear land of bramble, especially when it is stony; for the bramble puihes and interweaves its roots among the stones, which renders it necefi'\'' ary to dig out the stones before it can be sufficiently rooted up by ploughing or tearing. However, digging out the stones, and ploughing the land in such a manner as is most proper for cutting and tearing up the roots of bramble, may be the more liifely recommended, as they at the same time serve many other useful purposes. 2. Of Water, as an Impediment to Vegetation. Some plants require a greater, and some a lefler proportion of water in their food. The plants usually cultivated in our fields are of the latter kind, and are easily injured by an overproportion of water. Hence, water may be considered as an impedement to vegetation; and it becomes necessary to consider the moll proper methods of conveying it off the land. Of draining Land. Some lands are wet from their situation, being exposed to overflowings from higher grounds, and having no proper descent to allow the water to run off. The bottom of some land is of such a nature as to force out, in springs, the water that runs below the surface. Springs sometimes bieak out, because the channels, in which they run, reach the surface; and sometimes because they are interrupted.in their course, which makes them force their way above ground. The wetness of land is sometimes occasioned by violent and frequent rains; and.fcmetimes all these causes may concur in rendering land wet.Land that is wet from its situation may be drained in this manner : Although the wet land be so low, as to render it difficult to carry off diewater; yet the water may be intercepted by adrain, before it reaches the low ground. Land, w^et by springs, lies generally in a Hoping drreftion, which makes it the more easy to drain. When the water runs near the surface, before it breaks out, it may be intercepted by a drain* drawn across the declivity, a little above the place where it sir st makes its appearance. But, if the channel lies deep, the drain ffiould be drawn direttly across where it springs up. But, when the wetness of the land is owing to the climate, or a rainy season, the U'\'' ater cannot be interrupted by drains • however, obllrud Hons may be remo,ved, so as to allow the water to run off as quickly as possible. To drain land in this situation, it is necessary to lay it up in ridges properly placed, and to cut fmali drains across these ridges, communicating with each other, and with the furrows. By this method all the furrow'\'' s betwixt the ridges become drains; the water, as it falls upon the ridges, immediately makes its way to the furrows; and, if it meets with an interruption in any of them, it is conveyed by the drains across the Von. I. No! 3. 3 L T U R E. 55 ridges into some other furrow, along which it is carried off the field. There are two kinds of drains, viz. open drains, and hollow drains. Hollow drains differ from open ones, in being filled with loose Hones, covered with turff, brufhwood, or straw, and a layer of earth thick enough to allow a plough to go’easily through above. These hollow drains are attended with two advantages; no land is loll by them, and they are no impediment in ploughing. Open drains, however, are in most cases preferable to hollow ones: They alone are capable of intercepting 0verflowings from higher grounds, and for carrying off water that falls in tain. The water in these cases being always on the surface, will run freely over hollow drains, especially when situated on a declivity. But hollow drains may be used with advantage in land wet by springs ; because nothing more is required than to continue the channels of the water below ground, and not allow it to break out, till it arrives at a place where it can do no harm. It will not be improper here to mention, that some foils retain water much longer than others, and consequently are more liable to be damaged by water. Soils that have a large proportion of clay, or of moss, are of this kind. As these foils naturally retain water like a ipunge, calling drains, and laying the land up in ridges,, will not convey it away. To drain such lands, their nature, and power of retaining water, must be changed by culture. The claysoil can only be drained by frequent stirring, and the application of such manures as raise a fermentation, These operations open the pores of the soil, and thereby afford a free paflage to the water. The mossy soil, on the other hand, is too open and porous, but is poffefied of an absorbing quality, by which it retains the water. To drain this soil, it is necessary to condense it, and, if possible, to destroy its quality of retaining water. Frequent ftirrings, and fdch manures as raise a fermentation, and tend to putrefy the moss, are said to render it firm and solid, and thereby both prevent it from receiving so large a quantity of—water, and destroy the quality of retaining it. Of draining Marifbes. The soil of mariffies, being composed of dissolved vegetables, dull blown in by the winds, and earth waffied down from the high grounds with which they are generally surrounded, is light and fpungy, but very rich and valuable when drained. In draining a mariffi, all the stagnating water Ihould be firll carried off'\'' by a large open drain, with a sufficient fall, and as deep as the bottom of the mariffi. When the stagnating water is conveyed away, the earth by degrees will subside, and become folk!; and £bme land will thus be gained on each side: The bottom likewise soon becomes firm enough to allow the drain to be gradually carried forward through the middle of the mariih.'\'' If the springs, which supply the water, rise near the middle of the mariffi, tifss principal drain, with a few bi .inches on each side, where the firings are large!! or O molimost numerous, will, be sufficient. But, if the springs be irregularly dispersed through the whole marilh, as is frequently the case, sidedrains parallel to the principal one will be nece/Tary to intercept the water that comes from the higher grounds and fepplies the springs. Cross drains, communicating with the parallel and principal drains, are likewise necessary; and should all be kept open till the soil hath fully subsided, and become firm; then the sidedrains and crossdrains may be converted into hollowdrains, in the manner above described. But the principal drain, especially if the marifii be extensive, ftiould always remain open. S e c t. V. Of Tillage. Tillage is the operation of breaking the soil into small particles, by (Hrrihg and turning it over, laying it tip in ridges, lire. In this part of agriculture, it is necefiary to be acquainted with the different foils proper for nourishing plants; the indruments best adapted for stirring and turning them over; and the conftruftion and manner of using these inflruments. Soils, with refped; to tillage, may be divided into stiff and light, wet and dry, deep and {hallow. This division is the more proper on this account, that the method of performing the operation of tillage has always a reference to one or more of these qualities of soil, and to no other. The indruments employed in tillage are various ; as the plough, the harrow, the roller, ire. which are again greatly diversified by differences arising from their condruftion and particular uses. i. Of the Scots Plough. In Scotland, this plough is dill the mod common and the mod generally underdood. If properly made, it is the bed plough for answering all purposes, when only one is used; though others are, perhaps, more proper for some particular purposes. The parts of which this plough is .composed are, the head, the beam, the sheath, the wred, the moldboard, the two handles, the two rungs, the fock, and the coulter; the two lad are made of iron, and all the red of wood. The Head, Plate VIII. fig. i. is designed for opening the ground below. The length of the head from A to B is about twenty inches, and the breadth from A to D about five inches; C is the point upon which the fock is driven,'\'' and the length from B to C is about six inches ; a is the mortoife into which the larger handle is fixed; and b is the mortoife into which the {heath is fixed. The head is that part of the plough which goes in the ground; therefore the shorter and narrower it is, the friffion will be the left, and the plough more easily drawn; but the longer the head is, the plough goes more deadily, and is not so easily put out of its direction by any obftnndions that occur. Twenty inches is considered as a mean length; and five inches as the mod convenient breadth. The Skeath, fig. 2. E, is driven into the mortoife, fig. i. b, and thus fixed to the head A B. It is not perpendicular to the head, but placed obliquely, so as to make the angle formed by the lines A B and E B about 60 degrees. The {heath is about 13 inches long, besides what is driven into the mortoife b; about three inches broad, and one inch thick. The {heath is fixed to the moldboard, as in fig. 11. E, in the same manner as the wred is fixed to the head in si g7The Moldboard is designed to turn over the earth of the furrow made by the plough ; and it is obvious, that, according to the position of the {heath, the moldboard will turn over the earth of the furrow more or left fuddefily. Besides, when it forms a left angle with the head than 60 degrees, the plough is in great danger of being choked, as the farmers term it. The Larger Handle, fig. 3. F A, is fixed to the head, by driving it into the mortoile a, fig. 1. It is placed in the same plane with the head; and its length from A F is about five feet four inches, and its diameter at the place where it is fixed to the beam is about two inches and a half, and tapers a little to the top F. About ten inches from A, there is a curve in the handle, which, when F is raised to its proper height, makes the lower part of it nearly parallel to the {heath E B. This curve is designed to strengthen the handle. The proper position of the handle is, when the top F is about three feet two inches higher than the bottom of the head A B. The longer the handles, the plough is the more easily managed, because the levers are more distant from the centre of motion. The higher the top of the handles, the plough is more easily raised out of the ground, provided they be no higher than the lower part of a man’s breast. v The Beam, fig. 4. is fixed to the larger handle and the {heath, all of which are placed in the same plane with the head. The length of it, from H to I, is about six feet; its diameter is about four inches. When the plough is in the ground, the beam ftiould be just high enough not to be incommoded by any thing on the surface. The position of the beam depends on the number of cattle in the plough. When two horses are yoked, the beam ftiould be placed in such. a manner as to make the perpendicular distance betwixt the bolthole of the beam and the plane of the head about 21 inches; when four horses are yoked, two abreast, this distance ftiould only be about 18 inches. The Sock, fig. 5. B P, is fixed to the end of the head, and is about two feet long. In sitting the fock to the head, the point ought to be turned a little to the land or left side ; because otherwise> it is apt to come out of the land altogether. When turned to the left, it likewise takes off more land; when turned upwards, the plough goes {hallow; and when downwards, it goes deeper. The Coulter, fig. 6. is fixed to the beam, and is about two feet ten inches long, two inches and a half broad, (harp at the point and before, and thick on the back, like a knife. It is fixed and diredted by wedges, so as to make the point of it equal to, or rather a little beforebefore the point of the Took, and upon a line with the left side of the head. This oblique position enables it 10 throw roots, <bc. out of the land, which requires less force than cutting or puihing them forward. The Wrest, fig. 7. B D, is fixed to the head, and is about 26 inches long, two broad, and one thick. It is fixed to the head at B, in such a manner as to make the angle contained between the lines A B and B D about 2J degrees. The wrest is seldom or never placed in the lame plane with the head, but gradually raised from the place where it is fixed to it; that is, from B to K, as in fig. 8. The position of the wrest determines the nature of the furrow. When the wrest is wide and low set, the furrow is wide; and when it is narrow and high set, the furrow is narrow. Fig. 9. represents the two Handles, fixed together by the two rungs. The larger handle has been already described; the Idler one is a few inches Ihorter, and does not require to be quite so strong. The distance of the handles at the little rung depends on the position of the wrest. Their distance at M and P is about two feet six inches. The lefler handle is fixed to the moldboard at M, fig 10. and to the wrest K B, at L. Fig. ir. represents the plough complete, by joining together figures 6. and 10. in the Iheath E B. The wrest B K is supposed to make an angle with the head A B, as in fig. 7.. and the handles joined together, as in fig. 9. After having given such a particular description of all the parts and proportions of the Scots plough, it will easily appear how it separates, raises, and turns over the earth of the furrow. If it had no coulter, the earth would open above the middle of the fock, and in a liae before the sheath; but as the coulter opens the earth in a line with the left side of the head, if the soil has any cohefion, the earth of the furrow will be wholly raised from the left side, and as the fock moves forward, will be throwrt on the right side of the ftieath, and by the calling out of the moldboard, or the raising of the wrest, will be. turned over. This plough, though the best general one, is not altogether perfedt. As the fock is high in the middle, and round on the sides, and as the point of it is in a line with the middle of the head, a great force is necefiary ■ to raise the earth of the furrow. Besides, as the {heath is nearly in a line with the point of the fock, and to the right of the lefr side of the head, the earth of the furrow, as it is raised, must strike against the {heath, and a part of it, instead of being turned wholly to the right, will fall to the left side. These defedts make the plough heavy to draw; and, besides, this position of the {heath renders the Scots plough improper for hoeing, as the earth that falls to the left buries the young plants in the rows. To remedy the defedls arising from the fock, it fiiould be made straight on the landside, so as to be in a line v/ith the land or left side of the head; and straight also below, so as to be in a line with the under side of the head, {loping on the furrow or left side; and likewise on the upper side from the point, so as to make it, at the root, about seven inches broad, and three inches, thick ; at the same time flcping all the way from the land to the furrow, so as to form the furrowside into a {harp edge. It is obvious, that this fock will meet with less resistance than the common one, will raise the earth of the furrow wholly from the left side, and turn it as it is raised. To remedy the defedt '\'' arising from the {heath, it {hould be brought a little nearer the larger handle, and another {heath {hould be fixed a little before it, to the left or landside of the head and beam ; to this {heath the moldboard {hould be fixed. If this be done, the earth of the furrow, as it is raised, will be resisted by the moldboard only, and wholly turned to the right. The Bridle, or Muzzle, is another article belonging to the plough. It is fixed to the end of the beam, and the cattle are yoked by it. The muzzle commonly used is a curved piece of iron, fixed to the beam by a bolt through it. In fig. 12. ABC is the muzzle, A C the bolt by which it is fixed to the beam; D is the fwingletree, or crosstree, to which the traces are fixed ; and B is a hook, or cleek, as it is commonly called, which joins the muzzle and fwingletree. Someufe another kind of muzzle, fig. 13. A B C D. It is fixed to the beam by two bolts, and has notches by which the cleek of the fwingletree may be fixed either to the right or the left of the beam. There are also different holes for the hindbolt to pass through, by which the draught may be fixed either above or below the beam. A D is the sorebolt upon which the muzzle turns ; on B C are four notches, betwixt any two of which the cleek of the fwingletree may be fixed. When the cleek is fixed at B, the plough is turned towards the firm land, and takes off a broader furrow; and'\'' when fixed at C, it is turned towards the ploughed land, and takes off a narrower furroty. E and F are the holes on each side through which the hindmost bolt passes. When the bolt is put through the highest two, these holes being thereby brought to the middle of the beam, the sorepart of the muzzle is raised above the. beam, and the plough is made to go deeper; and when put through the lowest two, the sorepart of the muzzle is sunk below the beam, and the plough is made to go ftiallower. This muzzle may be so conftrufted as to have the same play with the common one. Fig. 16. A is the end of the beam; B a plate of iron sunk into it, and, with a similar one in the other side, is rivetted into it by bolts; C is the muzzle fixed to these plates of iron by the bolt D, which bolt may be put through any of the holes E E. From the construction of this muzzle it is plain, that it has the same play with the common one, and that by it the land of the plough may be altered at pleasure. Of the Plough with the curved Moldboard. The moldboard of the Scots plough is not quite straight, but is call out above, and more and more so as it approaches the lesser handle. Ploughs with a curved moldboard commonly have no wrest, the moldboard serving for both. The underpa,t of it, which serves in place of the wrest, becomes parallel to the plane of the head as it approaches the handle; and sometimes, after alias passed the handle.is made to turn inwards; and the sorepart of it, which is straight below, is more and more curved the further up it comes, resembling the bow of a ship/j If one moldboard be preferable to another, it mufi be either because it throws the earth of the furrow more properly, or makes the plough more easily drawn. Now, the use of the moldboard is to raise the earth, turn it over, and, if it be taken off narrow, to ftiift it a little to the right hand. The common moldboard, when right made, performs all these operations gradually. But the curvedmoldboard, as it is call out above in the sorepart, prevents the furrow from rising, and turns it over suddenly. In land that easily breaks in pieces, the common moldboard has the advantage, because it raises the earth of the furrow higher than the other, and leaves it more loose and open. But the curved moldboard is preferable in land that is not easily broke, for, by turning over the earth suddenly, it is apter to tear it asunder. The plough is more easily drawn by the common moldboard, as it has less fridion than the curved one. Of the Plough with the feathered Sock. The difference between the feathered and the common fock will be bell understood by comparing their figures. Fig. 14. is the common fock, and fig. 15, the feathered one. From the conftrudion of the feathered fock, it is obvious, that it mufi meet with greater resistance than the common fock. However, when the plough takes off the earth of the furrow broader than that part of the fock which goes upon the head, it is more eafilydrawn than the plough wjth the common fock; for the earth whiter the common fock leaves to be opened by the wrest, is more eafi’.y opened by the feather of the other fock. In lea, the feathered fock makes the plough go more easily, because the roots of the grass, which go beyond the reach of the plough, are more easily cut by the feather than they can be torn asunder by the common fock. The feathered fock is also of great use in cutting and defiroying rootweeds. The common fock, however, answers much better in strong land. It is proper here to add, that in sitting the feathered fock to the head, the point of it Ihould be turned a little from the land, or a little to the right hand. Of the Wheeled Plough. Th e Scots wheeled plough is formed by adding wheels to the old Scots plough, and giving it a curved moldboard, or feathered fock, according to the inclination of the farmer. The advantage or disadvantage of the wheels is therefore the only thing to be ccnfidered in this place. The following are the principal advantages of wheel'\'' s to a plough of this kind. Wheels regulate the plough; tlpey make it go to a certain depth, take off the earth of the furrow of a determinate breadth, and make the plough very easy to manage. Wheels likewise make it L T U R E. easy for the ploughman to keep the ridges straight, which it is difficult to do without them. The disadvantages attending a wheeled plough are nearly equal to its advantages. It has too muchmachinery, which is an inconvenience in any inftrurnent... It is improper for ploughing ridges across. It is'\'' uifo very inconvenient for ploughing narrow ridges; for it Wnrft be frequently altered in ploughing out a ridge. The wheel that goes in the furrow being higher than the other, when both wheels are going upon the furfircc, the beam must be changed from its ordinary pofiticn, and placed in such a manner as to keep th§ plough even, and to make it go a little deeper than ordinary. When a furrow is made for the wheel to go in, the'\''be am must be altered again to its ordinary position ; and when the ridge is near finilhed, so that both wheels are going irj furrows, the position of the beam must be changed, to keep the plough even, and to prevent it from going too .deep. Of the Fourcoultered Plinigh. In England, this plough is said to be used with success. But after repeated trials by those who attempted to use it in Scotland, they have been obliged to give it up. So many coulters in the ground at once must meet with many obstacles, which will give different direftions to the plough, according to the different parts of the coulters to which the resistance is applied. Besides, it is difficult to place the planes of the coulters exadlly parallel to each other; and if this be not done, they will be continually a (Sling upon the plough in different directions. When this plough is employed for breaking up grassgrounds, which is the chief design of it, the oblique position of the coulters is apt to raise the turf in such q. manner as to intangle it betwixt them, and thereby entirely stop the plough. This plough ftiould always be made with wheels for regulating its direction; the planes of the coulters flioukl be exactly parallel to each other: The first coulter must be set almost perpendicular, and (hot!Id not go above two inches deep; the second ftiduld Hope a little, and go somewhat deeper than the first, and so on to the last. Soft meadowland, free from stones^ is best adapted to the nature of this plough. Of the Iron Plough. This plough is formed upon the model of the old Scots plough; only the several parts of it are fliorter, and'\''the head and fock are of one piece like the English plough.ftiare. I Tiis plough is lighter, and cenfequently more easily drawn than any other plough used in Scotland ; and, as it is {hotter, the friction is also diminiffied. Neither is the earth so apt to stick to it, and clog it while going. But these are only seeming advantages ; for thelightness and ftiortness of it render it extremely subject to change its direction upon meeting with the ieaft obstruction. Soft land.land, vith few flrbnes, therefore, is the only land in which it can be employed with advantage. The iron plough is fubjed to another iriconveniency. When any thing goes wrong, it cannot be redified on the field, but must be carried to the smithy, which is often at a considerable distance. Of yoking Cattle in Ploughs. It is not easy to determine whether horses or oxen, or both together, are most proper for drawing ploughs ; because, in this country, such a determination depends on circumstances almost as various as the number and.situation of farms in it. If, indeed, real labour alone was sufficient to determine this point, oxen would be preferred ; because they will Hand to the draught, and overcome a resistance which horses would yield to. We shall therefore confine this head to the manner of yoking cattle, without regard to the kind of cattle employed. The chief question on this fubjed is, Whether cattle fliould be yoked in pairs, or in a line before one another ? The mod common way of yoking cattle is in pairs. Though this, upon the whole, be the best method, yet it is fubjed to some disadvantages. In ploughing the furrows betwixt the ridges, the cattle go upon the ploughed land, and tread it down with their feet, which is peculiarly hurtful to wet land : When there is but as much of the ridge unploughed as the cattle have hardly room to go upon, they frequently give the plough a wrong diredion by going into the opposite furrow; or, which is still worse, they are apt to justle the furrowcattle upon the ploughed land. To remove these inconveniencies, yoking the cattle in a line has been recommended. But this method has been attended with greater inconveniencies than those it is intended to remedy. When yoked in this manner, they go all in the furrow, which makes it neceflary to give the plough more land than ordinary, either by means of the fock or muzzle ; and consequently makes the draught too heavy. Besides, when cattle are yoked in a line, it gives some of them an opportunity of throwing the chief burden upon the others. There is still another inconveniency attends this method. When the cattle are all in a line, the whole force is applied to the diredion of the traces of the hindmost horse; and consequently it cannot have such an effed'\'' on the plough as when a part of it is in a more horizontal diredion. Each of these methods, however, may he used with advantage in certain circumstances; yoking in pairs, as it is certainly the strongest draught, should be preferred in ploughing stiff land. On the other hand, yoking in a line answers best in wet land, which is liable to be much hurt by the treading of the cattle. Of Ploughing. Ploughing is the adion of the plough in stirring and turning over the soil. By opening the soil and eniarging the surface, it gives it an opportunity of extradVol. I. No.3. 3 L T U R E. 57 ing the vegetable food from the air; and consequently increases the food of plants. Ploughing likewise dissolves and reduces to a state of putrefadion the dung, oils, and vegetable substances that happen to be mixed with the soil, and prepares them for entering the roots of plants. When properly managed, ploughing destroys weeds, and drains the land when too wet. Hence, ploughing is one of the most important operations in agriculture, and therefore merits the greatest attention. When ploughing is designed to enrich the land, or increase the food of plants, the surface cannot be made too uneven; because the more of it is by this means exposed to the influence of the air. But when the intention of ploughing is to destroy feedweeds, the surface cannot be made too smooth, nor the mold too much, broken ; because, by this management, their vegetation is promoted, and consequently they may be more completely destroyed by ploughing them in. Again, if you plough with a view to remove wetness, the land must be laid up in high ridges; for the greater the number of furrows, and the higher the ridges, the water is more expeditioufty carried off. Thus the manner of ploughing must always depend on the objedt in view. It frequently happens indeed, that two or more of these objedts require our attention in ploughing the same piece of land. But the methods above mentioned are perfedtly consistent with each, and may be combined so as to answer any intention that may occur. In ploughing, there are some general rules to be observed, whatever be the objedt in view. Thus, land ftiould never be ploughed when it is wet, because the intention of it will be frustrated, whatever may be the nature of the soil. A stiff soil, when ploughed wet, dries suddenly, and becomes hard. If a light soil be ploughed wet, the water hinders it from being reduced to small enough particles. Besides these disadvantages, the labour becomes very severe on the cattle, and the land is much hurt by their treading. With regard to ploughing lee, or opening up grassgrounds, the common pradtice in Scotland is to plough it as shallow and narrow as pofiible, and to let the turf upon its edge. After this single furrow, the land is sown, and if it be good, a profitable crop may be expedted; and the turf will be completely rotten before, next season. On the contrary, in breaking up of barren land, it should be ploughed deep, and the turf turned on its back. Of Ridges. It was formerly observed, that ploughing in ridges removes wetness, enlarges the surface, and consequently affords more space for the plants to extradt nourishment from the soil. When the soil is wet, the ridges ought to be narrow, and steep; because, by this means, the number of drainsis increased, and the water finds its way more easily into the furrows. They should Hkewife be raised high in the P middlemiddle or crown ; for the higher they are raised, the more is the surface enlarged. However, if the soil be shallow, the ridges (hould not be raised high, as they deprive the furrows of soil. But, in low flatlying ground, the ridges flfould be st'\'' iade flat, in order to raise the furrows ; for, in some cases, the higher the furrows are raised, it is the more easy to find a fall for carrying off the v/ater. Flat ridges are also capable of being sown with greater exaftness. It is impracticable to give any general rule for laying out ridges. In some situations, narrow ridges are preferable to broad ones ; in others, flat ridges are better than steep ones, <bc. In laying out of ridges, therefore, every person must be determined in this point by the nature and situation of the soil, and the advantages or disadvantages of the different kinds of ridges. But, whatever be the nature or situation of the soil, the ridges should always be made flraight. Id ploughing crooked ridges, the cattle mud often go in a different direction from the plough, and are obliged to take short turnings, which hurt the land by the treading of the cattle. Besides, when the ridges are crooked, the fall for the water is diminished. In all foils too, the ridges should be made of the same breadth throughout, and equal to one another. When they are unequal, it is difficult to sow them with exa Cbness, or to alter them when necessary ; and the plough mud often turn in the middle of the ridge, which hurts the land by the trampling of the cattle. Of the Position of the Ridges. It is a matter of some consequence to know how ridges should be placed, so as bed to answer the situation of the land. In lands that have a Hope, the ridges are commonly placed in a draight line from the top to the bottom of the declivity. When the declivity is gentle, this position is very proper, as it drains the land of water. But when the declivity is great, this pofitiott allows the soil to be washed away by the rain ; and the quantity of soil carried off will always be in proportion to the violence with which the current runs: Hence, in a soil situated in this manner, the ridges should be placed across the declivity, to prevent the soil from being carried down by the water. Making the ridges very narrow will, in a good measure, answer the same purpose'\'' ; however, it is not so proper as placing them across the declivity. When land is very dry, cross ridges are also of great mfe; for they retain the water, and prevent the soil from being washed away. Of ploughing in Ridges. There are three different ways of ploughing in ridges, viz. gathering, carting, and cleaving. By gathering, the crown and furrows of the ridge are kept in the same position in which they were before : the plough begins in the crown, and plows out the ridge, turning the earth towards the crown,, where it first en L T U R E. tered. Every ridge is ploughed by itself; or the halves of two contiguous ridges may be ploughed together. By this method, as the earth on each side is turned upon the crown, and thrown up out of the furrows, the ridge must be raised higher. By cajling, the crowns and furrows are likewise kept in they former position: The ridges are ploughed in pairs : The plough may enter in the furrow betwixt the ridges, and plough out the ridges, turning the earth towards the furrow where it entered; or, the plough may enter in the furrov/ on the right side of the two ridges, then turn to the One on the left, and plough out the ridges, turning the earth to these furrows, and from the furrow that is betwixt them. By this method of ploughing, the ridges are kept of the same height in the crown, and one of the furrows made a little higher, and the other a little lower than before. Cleaving is the reverse of gathering. The plough enters in the furrow on the rightside of the ridge, turns to the furrow on the leftside, and ploughs out the ridge, turning the earth from the crown towards the furrows. Every ridge is ploughed by itself, or the halves of two contiguous ridges may be ploughed together. If the ridge be raised in the crown, this method of ploughing makes it flatter, by throwing some of it into the furrows. , There is another method of ploughing used in some places, called ribbing. This method is performed by making furrows about two feet dirtant from each other. One half of the surface is untouched by the plough ; and the other half, which the plough turns up in making the furrows, is thrown on the top of what remains fart. The land may be ploughed in this manner either without regard to ridges, or the plough may be 1 made to enter and turn, as in gathering, carting, or cleaving. This kind of ploughing is seldom practised, but in the beginning of winter, and upon land to be sown with barley, after two additional clean ploughings. Although some modern improvers have condemned ribbing, it certainly has its uses : It keeps the land dry ; the rain that falls is confined to the furrows, from whence it is easily carried off; it promotes the rotting of the stubble, and exposes a greater part of the soil to the influence of the air. , Of Harrows. The harrow is an instrument employed for ftnoothing the surface after the land is ploughed. One horse is sufficient to draw the harrow commonly used in Scotland. Sometimes two of them go abreast, and sometimes three. When the surface is very rough, two are reckoned sufficient for the attention of one person : But when three can be used, they make better work, and are nearly equal to two pair. There are several kinds of harrows used in Scotland. The common one is so well known that it needs no defeription. When the land is rough, the harrows are apt to ftam, and get atop of each other. To prevent this, some six pieces of crooked timber to the outside bulls that are contiguous to one another, which, by stretching a little over.over, keep the harrows in their proper place. Others couple the harrows in such a manner as to allow them to go before and fall back of each other, and at the same time turn upon a hinge. When stiff land is ploughed wet, it rises in large pieces, which, when dry, become so hard, that the common harrows make no impreffiori on them. To reduce this kind of land, a large harrow, called a break, has been contrived. The breakharrow is sometimes made of the same figure with the common harrow, and sometimes in a triangular form. Both kinds are made heavier or lighter according to the nature of the soil for Which they are intended. Some of them are so heavy as to require six or eight cattle to draw them. But the heaviest kind are very improper for land infested with large fast Hones ; because their weight hinders them from flarting over the Hones; and therefore they are often in danger of being torn asunder by the cattle. There is another harrow, which, though little used, will be found to be very useful in many cases. It is of the same form with the common harrow, but much broader. The bulls are at a greater di Hance, and confcquently'\'' the teeth thinner placed ; the teeth are longer than those of the common harrow, but very little thicker ; and those in the sorepart Hope forward. It is made of such a weight as to be easily drawn by a couple of horses. This harrow goes deeper, opens land better, fcovers the feed deeper, and is more proper for tearing up roots than the common harrow. The French harrow is of a triangular form, with a joint near the angle, to which the draught is fixed. It has two handles, by which it is either made to go deep br shallow, as occasion requires. Its principal use is to level Heep ridges, which it does mod eflefiually. It is drawn across the ridges: When, at the crown of the ridge, by pressing on the handles, the harrow sinks down, and carries earth along with it to the furrows; and, When at the furrow*, by lifting up the handles, the harrow is brought out of the ground, and leaves the earth behind. This operation, however, is extremely improfier, unless the land be in a very dry situation, and not iable to be damaged by water. Of Harrowing. Harrowing smooths the surface, de Hroys weeds, and covers the feed after it is fawn. When the intention of harrowing is to de Hroy rootweeds, the harrows should be drawn across the ridges. However, if such weeds are not fully tofn up, the liarrowing, by filling up the hollows, and defending the toots from the drought, rather promotes their grov/th. For this reason, harrowing is improper for deilroying rootweeds, excepting after a springsallow, when the land is soon after to be ploughed for feed. But the smoother the surface is made, and the more the mold is broke, the vegetation of the feedweeds is the more effeftually promoted, and of course they are the more liable to be defiroyed by harrowing. If the season be favourable, the land may be harrowed several times, and as many crops of weeds deflroyed. L T U R E. 59 A light fpungy soil can hardly get too much harrowing ; for the more it is harrowed, it becomes the firiher. But if the soil be Hiff, the less harrowing it gets, the better, provided the purposes proposed can be answered. The common method of harrowing after the feed is sown, is firfl along the ridges, then across, and then along again. When the ridges are flat, they maybe harrowed either along or across; and the work may be begun or ended either way. But when the ridges are Heep, it is improper to begin by harrowing across, because too much of the feed will be drawn into the furrows. Of the Roller. The roller is intended for smoothing the surface, and making the land firmer. Rollers are sometimes made of Hone, sometimes of wood, and sometimes of iron : but the only eflential difference of rollers lies in their weight. As rollers, in different circumflances, require to be lighter and heavier, they are generally confiru&ed so that their weight can Cither be augmented or diminiflied. The common roller, in turning, is very severe upon the cattle, for it does not move on its axis, but is dragged along the surface. To remove this inconvenience, a roller has lately been conflrufted with a division in the middle, as if two rollers were joined together. In turning, both parts of this roller move round their axis, the one forward, and the other back. Of Rolling. Rolling is pradtifed with advantage, both on land lying in grass, and in tillage. It presses down molehills, smooths the surface, and makes pa Huregrass Hool, and grow thicker. Rolling upon land in tillage, not only smooths the surface, but breaks clods that the harrow cannot reduce. In a light soil, the roller fliould be applied immediately after the feed is sown; it is peculiarly useful to this kind of soil, by condensing and making it firmer. , Of Sowing. It is remarked by farmers, that the corn which is ear Jitfl sown is in general fooriefl ripe. However, as this operation depends on the nature of the weather, and a number of other circum Hances, no precise time can be fixed for performing it. The pradtic C of fbwing wheat, oats, barley, &c. at different times of the year, seems not to depend so much on the different natures of these grains, as on the inconveniencies which would attend the sowing them all at the same time. It may however be observed, that wheat, the only grain in this country which is sown before winter, should be sown as early as poflible, that its roots and leaves may be put forth before the frofl comes on. The niofl common method of sowing is by the hand. This method requires great skill and address in the fower: lor, at the same time that he gives his arm a circular motion, to cafl the feed with Hrength, he mufl open his handhand gradually, that it may not fall in a heap, but be pr.perly scattered and spread. It is remarkable, that good fowers, by the force of habit, take their handful out of the sheet so very exactly, that they will sow any quantity of feed on an acre, according as it is designed to be thinner or thicker. , But this dexterity in a few fowers, is itself an objection to the method of sowing by the hand; because long pratfice and observation are necessary to make a good lower: This remark is too well justified by experience; for good fowers are extremely rare, and, in some places of the country, hardly to be got. Besides, in sowing by the hand, especially when the land is uneven, the feed rebounds on the clods, falls into the cavities, and often the greatest part of it is colledted in the furrows. Dif Ferent plants require to be sown at different depths. The same feeds, however, may be laid deeper in light than in strong foils. Wheat requires to be placed two inches and a half or three inches below the surface: And it may be laid down as a general maxim in sowing, that small feeds Ihould always be placed nearer the surface than such as are larger. Belides the unequal distribution of the feed when sown by the hand, too large a quantity of it may be used; for, as it is placed at different depths, that which is too deep never comes up, and that which lies on the surface, which may be observed on the bell harrowed land, is eat up by the birds. When feed is sown thin, and placed at equal distances by a drill, a lelfer quantity of it, by leaving room to spread and branch out, will produce even a better crop than a larger quantity sown irregularly by the hand. The sad has been confirmed by repeated experiments both in our own country and in France, Sect. VI. Of the Culture of particular Plants. Of the Culture of Wheat. Though wheat be the moll: valuable grain that is cultivated in Scotland, there are many places where it cannot be sown with advantage; for it requires not only a rich soil, but a warm climate. The Englilh writers mention about 13 or 14 different kinds of wheat; but in Scotland we seldom use more than two, viz. the white and the red wheat. The last is reckoned the moll hardy plant, and succeeds in some foils and climates where the white kind sails. Bearded wheat is used in some places. This is likewise a hardy plant, and is not so apt to lodge, or to be Ihaken out by the wind, as the other kinds. It succeeds very well in wet land, and the grain produces a great quantity of flour. The white wheat most commonly used in Scotland, is not a particular species, but a mixture of all the species cultivated in England. This mixture is probably occasioned by want of care in providing ourselves with foreign feed. It is found by experience, that, in this country at leaf!, wheat degenerates ; for which reason a freih supply is every year brought from the Englilh granaries, which generally consists of a mixture of all the kinds. Now it is at least very probable, that these different kinds of wheat require different foils; and therefore the farmer Ihould endeavour to provide himself annually with a quantity of unmixed wheat, of such kinds as are found to succeed bell in Scotland. Wheat is commonly sown either upon land that has been summerfallowed, or after a crop of pease. In the latter case, the feed cannot be sown till O&ober; but in the former, it is generally sown in August. However, in Scotland, we sow wheat from the beginning of Augult till the middle of November. Some have tried sowing wheat in the spring; but the plants were neither so vigorous, nor the grain so large, as those that were sown in autumn. The sowing of oats in autumn has likewise been tried; but, though the crop was bulky, the quantity of grain was not in proportion. Upon the whole, the month of O&ober seems to be the most proper time for sowing. wheat; when it is either earlier or later, it is fubjed to a number of dangers. The quantity usually sown upon a Scots acre, is from three to five firlots, Linlithgow measure, which is the measure always meant in this treatise. The proper quantity, however, must always depend upon the situation of the land: in proportion as it is clean and rich, a smaller quantity of feed is requisite; and in proportion as it is poor and full of weeds, a larger quantity becomes necessary. A wet bed is most proper for wheatfeed. In the month of August, or even the beginning of September, it is dangerous to sow,'\'' if there be not as much moisture in the land as to make the feed vegetate, especially if the feed has been steeped in brine, and dried with lime. But though the danger'\'' be great in sowing when the land is very dry, yet the belt situation of land for receiving feed is when it contains no more moisture than is sufficient to make the feed vegetate. When wheatland is light, or well reduced by fallowing, the feed Ihould be plftughed in, or the land allowed to lie some time after it is ploughed before the wheat be sown. By this the land acquires a degree of firmness before the harrows go upon it, and the feet of the cattle are prevented from prefling the feed too deep into it. Wheatland Ihould be ploughed so as to raise the ridges higher in the crown than is necessary on other occasions, in order to prevent it from being damaged by water : If the ridges are made narrower than ordinary, the same end will be served, because the water finds its way more easily to the furrows. Hence the old praftice in Scotland, of cleaving for pease, and gathering for wheat, was well founded. When the wheat is sown, and the land harrowed, the field should be carefully waterfurrowed; and if there be ridges at the ends for the ploughs to turn upon in ploughing, a waterfurrow should likewise be drawn betwixt them and the ridges, and the communication betwixt these and the furrows opened up.Of the Culture of Rye. Rye is a wintergrain, and thrives very well on land that is improper for wheat. As there is hardly a good market for this grain in Scotland, it is but Jittle cultivated. In some places, the land is prepared for it by a sallow, and good crops are reaped in this way. It may be sown in O&ober, November, or early in the spring. It may be sown after pease or barley; but it is improper to sow it after wheat or oats, as this would encourage the growth of rootweeds, and greatly exhaufl the land. Rye is sometimes sown as a grassfeed. If it.be sown wi^Ji this view in September, upon'\'' a wellprepared sallow, it will afford good feeding for sheep in March and April; and after it is cut down, the land may be ploughed, and sown with barley. This practice, however, will not answer in wet land. Of the Culture of Barley. There are four kinds of barley used in Scotland, the common barley, the Lincolnshire barley, the Highland barley, more commonly called rough bear, and the Thanet. These different kinds are sown at different feafbns. The Lincolnshire barley may be sown any time during the winter, or in the spring; the common barley and Thanet may be sown in April, the beginning of May, or even later; and the rough bear may be sown in May, or the beginning of June: but the precise time of sowing muff be determined by the weather and the situation of the land. When the season is favourable, the land free from weeds, and not too w'\'' et, Lincolnshire barley may be sown in February, and the other kinds sooner than the periods above mentioned. When barley is sown in winter, or early in the spring, •the land ought to be ploughed some time before; but when sown lat£ in the spring, or in the beginning of summer, it ought to be sown immediately after it is ploughed. In winter; or early in the spring, land is in no danger of becoming too dry; but in summer, land is very liable to become too dry for the purposes of vegetation. The farmer ftxould therefore endeavour to have all his feed sown before the season be too far advanced. The quantity of barley sown on an acre is from two to four firlots. When the land is clean and rich, two firlots are sufficient $. but when it is infested with weeds, a larger quantity is necessary. Barley has tender roots, and is not able to push them far in quell of food; it is therefoi'\'' e necessary to bring land deltined for barley into good tilth, and to enrich it either by manures or frequent ploughings. Barley is often sown upon land that has been fallowed, or after a crop of pease. In some places it is sown after a crop of oats ; and fbmetimes it is repeated for two or three years fuccelhvely upon the same land. When barley is to be sown upon sallow, in stiff land not much infelted with annual weeds, it should be dressed in November in the same manner as for wheat; so that Lincolnshire barley may be sown, if the winter be favourVol. I. No. 3. 3 L T U R E. 61 able, or Ipring barley upon the winterfurrow, if the season proves unfavourable. But when barley is to be sown after wheat, pease, or oats, the land should be ploughed as soon after harvest as possible, and laid up in such a manner as to be best exposed to the air and frofl, and to secure it againfl damage from rain. To answer these purposes, barleyland is sometimes ribbed at this season: But ribbing flirs only a small quantity of the soil; and therefore it is better to gather it into narrow ridges of four or six furrows each, and to make proper drains for carrying off the water. As the first ploughing for barleydand is designed to cover the stubble, increale the vegetable food, and keep the land dry, it need: not be very deep, but ought to be as broad as poflible, provided it be clean ploughed. If it be proposed to dung barleyland, the dung may be laid on during the winterfrofi, and ploughed in as soon as the land is in proper condition. When, the dunging is delayed till immediately before the iaft ploughing, dr feedfurrow, the land, especially if it be of a stiff nature, is in danger of being battered so as to rise in large clods when ploughed. In fleering, the ploughing should be as deep as the plough can go, and the soil allows : For by deep ploughing at this season, part of the earth that has been expo: fed to the air through the winter, and part of it turned up by the ordinary ploughing, are mixed together for the nourishment of the crop. In fleering, the. furrows, should not be so broad as in the former ploughing; on the contrary, the narrower they are the better. Crosspioughing is very proper at this season, if the land be sa dry as to allow it. After fleering, the land should be well harrowed. It makes the weeds spring, retains die sap, and, if the laml be tolerably dry, takes out the roots of the quickeninggrass. But, if the land be in no danger of losing the sap, the harrowing may be delayed for some time after it is ploughed; for by this method a greater number of weeds are deflroyed. Though, in general, frequent plpughings are beneficial, yet ploughing when the land is wet is deflruffive. When the spring is wet, the barleyland in many places'\'' is not in a proper condition to be sown. In this case, the fleeringfurrow muff be omitted, and the land should get the feedfurrow as soon as it is in a proper condi. tion. When barley is to be .sown a second time upon the same land, without any other crop intervening, two ploughings are sufficient. As our summers in Scotland are fbmetimes very wet, barleyland should be waterfurrowed, and drefied up in the same manner as wheatland. Of the Culture of Oats. The pat is a very hardy plant, and its roots are strong, which enables it to procure food where many other plants would starve; and hence the praffice of giving less culture to oats than to 1: any other grain. There are three kinds of oats used in Scotland, the white, the black, and the grey. The white is the moff common,common, and used in all the low countries ; the black is the hardiest, and is used in the cold hilly countries ; and the grey is often sown with success upon light gravel or sand. The white is again divided into two kinds, called cold feed and hot feed. There is scarcely any difference in appearance betwixt these; but the hot feed ripens eight or ten days before the cold. Experience must determine which of them ought to be chosen for feed. Though the oat be a hardy plant, and does not easily degenerate, yet the changing of feed is universally allowed to be a good praftice. This change should always be made from a warm soil to a cold, and from a cold to a warm. Oats are often sown upon grassground newly broken up, or, which is the same thing, upon lee once ploughed. They are likewise often sown after barley, sometimes after wheat, sometimes upon fallotv, and sometimes they are repeated for leveral years fucceflively upon the same land. In ploughing lea for oats, when the land is soft and mellow, the plough should go as shallow as possible ; and the earth of the furrows should be set upon its edges, to allow the harrows to have the greater impression in tearing k. But when the land is stiff, or the turf very tough, it is necessary to plough deeper, and to turn the turf fully over, so that the harrows may raise a kind of mold upon its back to fill up the hollows, and to nourish the feeds. When oats are to be sown upon lee, the land ought to be ploughed early in v/inter, that it may receive the greater benefit from the air and frost. It is usual to lime leaground intended for oats. This is a very good custom; for lime promotes the corruption of the grassroots, by which the land is sooner reduced. It is likewise common to spread the lime upon the sward some time before the land is ploughed : This is also very proper; for the lime is intangled in the sward, and is not io apt to penetrate too deep. Oats are generally sown after barley ; and the land is ploughed as soon as the wheatfeed is made, and the barleylabd has got the firfl furrow. The ilifr land, and land in danger of being damaged by wetness, should be firfl: ploughed, to give the one the benefit of the winterfrofl, and to put the other out of danger. It is likewise an advantage to light and dry land to be ploughed early in the.season, as it makes the flubble rot sooner, and exposes the soil longer to the air. It was formerly observed, that oats are sometimes sown upon sallow. In the hilly countries, they often sallow the land that has been in lea for some years ; and they find that this pradlice r does better than giving it only one ploughing in the winter before the feed is sown. In the low countries, this praftice of fallowing for oats is found to succeed very well. The sallow for oats should be managed through the summer in the same manner as if for barley or wheat. Before winter, it ought to get the last furrow, and be laid up in proper ridges, to preserve it dry during the winter. Oats may be sown in any of the wintermonths, or in the month of March. Some people have sown oats so early as the beginning of November, and have had good crops. But, if the land be properly laid up in winter, it is better to delay the sowing till March. The quantity of oats generally sown upon an acre, is from four to five firlots ; and should always get a dry bed. Of the Culture of Pease. The pea is a grain very different from any of those already mentioned. A crop of it is not so valuable, though it is much used in some places for bread. The straw of pease is reckoned better for feeding horses than the straw of any other grain. A crop of pease does not require such a quantity of nourifnment as a crop of any of the other grains mentioned above. When the crop is good, the straw covers the ground, and destroys all the small weeds by depriving them of a free communication with the air. Pease likewise minutely divide the particles of the soil; besides, they push their roots much deeper than any of the white grains, and extra A part of their nourishment from belovv the reach of the plough. There are two kinds of pease cultivated in Scotland, the white and the grey. The white is njoft common, and consists generally of a mixture of feverai kinds. All of these kinds seem to be species of the pea cultivated in our gardens. The grey pea seems to be a species of the vetch or tare. This is the hardiest plant of the two, and thrives on foils where the white pea does not succeed. The straw of the grey pease, and the pease themselves, are better for horses than those of the white. The farmer Ihould therefore cultivate this pea where th$ other does not thrive, although the value of the grain beinferior. The whke pea, like the oats, is divided into hot feed and cold feed. The sowing of the hot feed may be delayed three weeks after the cold feed is sown, and yet the pease will come as soon to maturity. The time of sowing is from the first of February to the end of April. The early sown pease have the best chance to produce a crop of corn, and the late sown to produce a crop of straw. However, when the land is clean and in good heart, the pease may be sown early; because, on such land, a good crop both of corn and straw may be expedled. But if the land be soul or wet, the sowing of pease ftiould be delayed, as long as possible; because on such land the crop is more precarious, and the sailing of a crop of pease gives such encouragement to weeds, as to endanger the following crops likewise. In such a case, to prevent the bad consequences that may follow, the crop ftiould be ploughed in; for when a bad crop of pease is allowed to stand, it does more harm to the land than all the value of the crop. The quantity of pease sown upon an acre, is from 4 to 5'\'' firlots. If the intention of sowing pease be to obtain straw, and enrich the land, they Ihould be thick sown; because in that case they have a better chance to destroy the weeds, and to cover the surface. But when the principal design is to have a crop of corn, they ftiould be thinner sown ; for, when thin sown, they have more air, and fill better. Pease are commonly sown after oats or barley, and sometimesfbmetimes after wheat. Seldom more than one ploughing is given to pease, and they are usually sov/n immediately after it. The reason of this practice is, that the feed may be better covered; for the sooner that any grain is sown after ploughing, it is always the deeper covered. If rain sails soon after pease are sown, it makes them swell and come aboveground, and then they are in danger of splitting, and of being destroyed by vermin. Sometimes pease are sov/n and ploughed in. This answers very well in light land, particularly'\''after a crop pf barley, the culture of which opens the soil. Land deligned for pease is generally cloven. This is a good pradlice when the ridges aresteep, as ail of them were formerly. As,wheat or barley are commonly sown after pease, the land mull be ploughed before winter. Gathering is the moll proper way of ploughing before winter, and this follows belt after cleaving. But if the ridges be not high, calling is die belt method of ploughing for pease ; or, if the ridges be flat and narrow'\'' , the land may be ploughed in the ordinary way, reverflng the former ploughing^ and turning the furrows into the crowns. Though pease are generally the lowellpriced grain, yet sometimes they rise to a great price, when the prices of other grains are moderate. This makes the faring of feed an article of great importance. By sowing in drills, one firlot will serve for an acre as compleatly as four in the bread callway: But the advantages of drilling fall to be conlidered afterwards. Of the Culture of Beat:?. What has been said with regard to die culture of pease, may be applied to beans. However, it is necef£ary to pbferve, that the bean pulhes its roots further down than the pea; and therefore requires a deeper soil. The lands in Scotland, wdiere beans are moll commonly sown, and where they succeed bell, are deep and wet clays. In some lands, the crops of beans are very great, and almoll as valuable as any grain. There is no crop succeeds better in the drillhulbandry than a crop of beans. Of the Culture of Ryegrass. Ryegrass is the moll common of all the artificial grades cultivated in Scotland, and not the Icall valuable. It is a fibrousrooted plant, and binds the soil ; this circurnflance has led many to think, that it greatly impoverilhes land. However, the culture of this grafa is attended with several peculiar advantages. It deltroys weeds, particularly the quickeninggrass, and grows upon foils which w'\'' ill not answer for any of the other artificial grafles. A fliallow, wet, Ipungy soil, or one which has a mixture of moss in it, is unfit for clover of every kind ; but experience fliows, that ryegrass, when unmixed with clover, will succeed upon any of these foils. Ryegrass is usually sown along with a crop of barley or oats. When sown along with barley, the field should be rolled, or well harrowed, to preserve the sap at the dry season of the barleyfeed. This precaution is not r L T U R E. 63 so necef Tary, when the ryegrass is sown along with oats ; because the land on which oats are sown is generally firmer, the sowing season is earlier, and consequently not so liable to be too dry. This grass seldom hurts the crop of corn. On the contrary, when the soil is loose and open, it makes it firm, and prevents the corn from lodging. Though the common method is to sow ryegrass with corn, yet, when the land is poor, it is better to sow it by itself, and Hill better to summersallow, and sow it in autumn. But, as the land by fallowing is made open '\'' and loose, and as the ploughing and sowing are near the rainy season, cattle ought not to be allowed to paflure upon it during the winter, except in the time of hard froll. Even when sown in the spring, the farmer fliould not allow much pailuring on it, especially in wet weather. But, if sown by itself, cattle may safely pallure upon it in the winter, as the roots, having nothing to obilrudt their progress, penetrate deeper, and spread wider, than when any other grain grows along with it. This practice, however, can only be followed with safety in very clean land ; otherwise weeds are apt to rise along with it, and prevent the surface from being covered; which, of course will keep the soil open. Ryegrass is sometimes sown for hay, and sometimes for paflure. When for hay, from two to four firlots are Commonly fawn upon an acre. Ryegrass rises very early in the spring, and, if ths soil be dry and warm, affords good paflure all the winter. It is very hardy. Hands the frofl, and, if continued in paflure, does not weir out in many years. The bell way of managing it is, to eat it down in the spring and beginning of summer, and then to let it rest till autumn. When allowed to get up in summer, it runs to feed, and becomes disagreeable to the cattle. Besides, by this method of managing ryegrass, a good crop may be ex, pe&ed in autumn. When propei ly managed, ryegrass makes very good hay ; and there is such a demand for the feed, that tho farmer is often tempted to let it stand till the feed is perfefted, and then to threfh it. When this is done, the hay can never be good; because the sap is cxhaufled, the stalk becomes dry and withered, and affords little Bourifhment to cattle. The hay ought therefore to be always cut before the. feed ripens. This pradtice not only makes the hest hay, but is likewise of great advantage to the land; for, when plants are allowed to perfect their feeds, the land is much more exhausted, than when they are cut before that period. Of the Culture of Clover. Though clover be used for the same purposes as ryegrass, it is, however, a plant of a very different nature. It has a large taproot, which penetrates the soil perpendicularly downward, and opens the earth and makes it free : The roots of clover cannot penetrate the soil, unless it be free and open. Hence, a dry, open, deep soil, free from quickengrass, is the moll proper for this plant. There arc several kinds of clover cultivated in Scotland,land, diuing'\'' .iiihed by the colour of their flowers, viz. the red, the v/hite, and the yellow. The red is the largest plant, has the strongest {talk, and broaddl leaves. The yellow sometimes grows tall, but the stalk is small; The white is the fmalleh plant,, and is sometimes called lopclover,from the resemblance its flowers bears tb those of the hop. Both the seasons and methods of flowing clover are various. * Most of the Engiifh writers recommend the autumn. It has frequently been tried, at this fleafon, in Scotland without success. When flown in spring, it anivers much better in this country. The common way of Towing clover, both in Scotland and England, is* along with wheat, oats, or barley, in the spring. This method is sometimes attended with di sad vantages. The clover sometimes hurts the corn, and the corn the clover. However, these disadvantages are probably more than overbalanced by the corn’s protcriing the clover from drought when very young, which it is much exposed to, especially when sown in the spring. As the lodging of corn deflrtys all plants that are below; to prevent this, the corn sown along with clover ought to be sown thin, and the la'\'' nd made very clean of weeds. • • «; Sometimes, in a wet se;>son, the clover gets atop of the corn, and deflroys the crop. This seldom happens when it is sown with barley or wheat; because it is much later in the season when sown with barley than when sown with oats, and therefore is not so far advanced at harvefl:; and the wheat is advanced so far before the cloverfeed is sown, that the clover can never get the better of it. To prevent, the clover, then, from hurting the corn, it may be town early in the season with wheat, or late in the season with barley. The Thanet barley, from the flxength of its roots and stalk, is not so apt to lodge as the common barley; and, of course, it is the most proper kind to be Town along with clover. But, as all kinds of barley are more apt to lodge than oats, and as the season for flowing oats is more proper for sowing clover than the Teafon of sowing barley, the farmer, when it is equally convenient Tor him, fliould prefer the sowing of clover with oats.^ When clover is sown with barley or oats, after these grains are sown, and the land harrowed, the cloverfeed is thin sown, and then the land is again harrowed or rolled. When the clover is Town with a crop of wheat, the clover is Town in the spring, and afterwards the wheat is rolled. It is common to Tow cloverfeed without any preparation given to tbe land; but it is better to harrow it before sowing. The harrowing does no harm to the wheat, and it makes the roller cover the feed more esse&ually. Cloverfeed may be sown in the same manner amongst oats or earlysown barley. Sometime after the corn has come up, the land may be harrowed, and the clover sown. If the weather be dry, the different parts of the operation fliould succeed one another as quickly as possible. The harrows Ihould be immediately followed by the fower, and the fower by the roller, to prevent the drought from penetrating too deep. The Englifli writers differ widely as to the quantity cf cloverfeed proper to be sown on an acre. However, L T . U R E. the farmers in Scotland, who sow clover with oats or barley, find, that from xo to 16 lb. of red, oi from 12 to x8 lb. of white clover on the acre, produces a very good crop. Clover, like ryegrass, is sometimes sown for hay, sometimes for pasture, and sometimes for both. The red clover is the most proper for hay, the white for pasture ; and, when both are intended, a mixture of the two answers best. When red clover is sown without being mixed with any other kind, the farmer ought to bring his land into tillage again in two or three years: For, after the second year, a crop of this kind of clover is of little value. When white clover is sown by itself, the farmer must : not expedt a crop of hay ; for it foldom rifos to such a height as to produce a good crop: But, to balance this, the field may be kept long in pasture, as this clover continues till wore out by the natural grass of the soil. When a mixture of the two are sown, feme crops of hay may be taken, and then the land may be allowed to lie some years longer for pasture. The red clover affords the crops of hay ; and the white remains till the natural grass rises. In this case, there is commonly sown upon the acre, from 8 to 12 lb. of red clover, and from 6 to 8 of white. But these proportions may be varied according to the judgment of the farmer. In Scotland, seldom more than one crop of hay in the season succeeds. The second crop is commonly so late, that it is very difficult to getthe hay properly made. It may therefore be paftured on, or cut green for cattle. When clover is cut green for cattle, it is a proper way to feed them upon a field that needs dung. This method is preferable to feeding them in stalls ; it saves the expence of carrying out the dung, and procures to the land the benefit of the urine, which is a very rich manure. Before coxicluding this article, it must be observed, that red clover, while green, is dangerous to blade cattle and flneep, when first given them, especially if wet with dew or rain. They ought therefore to be allowed it only sparingly at first, and brought to it by degrees/ After being accustomed to it for a few days, the danger is over, and they may be allowed to use as much of it as they please. Of the Culture of Clover mixed with Ryegrass, Red clover makes the best green forage Tor cattle. An acre of it will maintain more cattle than three or four acres of common grass: But then it is not so proper for hay. Cloverhay is very troublesome in making, and is not reckoned so good for feeding as some other kinds of hay. It likewise hurts the land, by encouraging the grov/th of quickening : grass. To remedy these disadvantages, it is common to sow ryegrass along with it. Clover, when mixed with ryegrass, is easier made into hay; the hay itself is much better; and the ryegrass, by covering the surface, prevents the growth of the quickeninggrass. The quantity sown upon the acre in this way is from 8 to 12 lb. of clover, and from 1 to 3 firlots of ryegrass. r rOf the Culture of StFoin. The writers on agriculture reckon this grass preferable to clover in many refpeds: They say, that it produces a larger crop; that it does not hurt cattle when eaten green; that it makes better hay ; that it continues four times longer in the ground ; and that it will grow on land that will bear no other crop. These are great advantages: But, as we have so little of that kind of grass in Scotland, it cannot be expefted that any directions can be given concerning the manner of cultivating it, founded Upon experience. We mud therefore confine ourselves to such facts as are mentioned by authors of the bed credit. Stfoin has a very long taproot, which is able to pierce very hard earthf The roots grow very large, and the larger they are, they penetrate to the greater depth; and hence it may be concluded, that this grass, when it thrives well, receives a great part ofits nourifliment from below die Jiaple of the soil: of course, a deep dry soil is bed for the culture of Stfoin. When plants draw their, nourilhment from that part of the soil that is near the surface, it is not of much consequence whether their^ number be great or small. But the case is very different when the plants receive their food, not only near, but also deep below the surface. Besides, plants that shoot their roots deep are often supplied with moidure, when those near the surface are parched with drought. To render the plants of Stfoin vigorous, it is necessary that they be fbwn thin. The bed method of doing this is by a drill; because, when sown in this manner, not only the weeds, but also the fupernumerary plants, can eafiiy be removed. It is several years before Stfoin comes to its full drength ; and the number of plants sufficient to dock a field, while in this imperfecd date, will make but a poor crop for the fird year or two. It is therefore necefl'\'' ary that it be sown in such a manner as to make it easy to take up plants in such numbers, and in such'\'' order, as always to leave in the field the proper number in their proper,places. This can only be dona with propriety, by sowing the plants in rows by a drill. Supponng a field to be drilled in rows at ten inches didance,. the partitions may be handhoed, and the rows dressed in such a mannpr as to le&ve a proper number of plants. In this situation the field may remain two years; then one fourth of the rows may be taken out in pairs, in such a manner as to make the beds of fifty inches, with six rows in each, and intervals of thirty inches, which may be ploughed. Next year, another fourth of the rows may be taken out in the same manner, so as to leave double rows with partitions of ten inches, and in'\'' tervals of thirty: All of which may be hoed at once or alternately, as it may be found modconvenient. The'\''great quantity of this grass which the writers oft this iubjett a*sure us may be raised upon an acre, and the excellency and great value of the hay made of it, Ihould induce farmers to make a complete trial of it, and even to use the spade in place of the hoe, dr hoeplough, if neceflary. The plants taken up from a field of Stfoin may be set Vol. I. No. 3. 3 L T U R E. 65 in another field; and if the tranfplaming of this grass succeeds as w'\'' dl as the tranfplanting of lucern has done with Mr Lunin de Chateauvieux, the trouble and expence will be sufficiently recompensed by the largeness of the crops. In tranfplantiog, it is necefiaty to cut off great part of the long taproot: this will prevent it from driking very deep into the soil, and make it pudi out large roots in a doping direftion from the cut end of the taproot. Stfoin managed in this manner, will thrive even on diallow land that fias a Wet bottom, provided it be not overdoeked with plants. Whoever inclines to try the culture of this grass in Scotland, Ihould take great pains in preparing the '\''land, and making it as free from weeds as pofiible. Of the Culture of Lucern. The writers on agriculture, ancient as well as modern, bedow the highed encomiums upon this grass, as affording excellent hay, and producing very large crops. Lucern remains at lead ten or twelve years in the gr#ind, and produces about eight tons of hay upon the Scots acre. There is but little of it cultivated in Scotland. However, it has been tried in several parts of this country; and it is found, that, when the feed is good, it comes up very well, and dands the winterfrod. But the chief thing that prevented this grass frorh being more used in this country, is the difficulty of keeping the soil open, and free from weeds. In a few years the surface becomes so hard, and the turf so drong, that it dedroys J the lucern before the plants have arrived at their greatest perfection: so that we cannot hope to cultivate lucern with success, unless we fall upon some method of dedroying the natural grass, and prevent the surface from becoming hard and impenetrable. This cannot be done effectually by any other means than horsehoeing. Thi$ method was fird proposed by Mr Tull, and afterwards pradtfed successfully by M. de Chateauvieux near Geneva; It may be of use therefore to give ^ view of that gem* tleman’s method of cultivating lucern. Pie does not mention any thing particular as to the manner of preparing the land; but only observes in general, that no pains ihould be fparedin preparing it. He tried the sowing of lucern both in rows upon the beds where it was intended to dand, and likewise the sowing it in a nursery, and afterwards tranfplarrting it into the beds prepared for it. He prefers tranfplanting; because, when transplanted, part of the taproot is cut off, and the plant (hoots out a number of lateral branches front the cut part of the root, which makes it spread its roots nearer the surface, atid consequently renders it more eafiiy cultivated: besides, this circumdance adapts it to a diallow soil, in which, if left in its natural date, it would not grow. The tranfplanting of lucenn is attended with many advantages. The land may be prepared in the summer for receiving the plants from the niirlery in autumn; by which means the field mud be in a much better situation than if the feed had been sown upon it in the spring. By tranfplanting, the rows can be made more regular, and the intended didances more exactly observed; and confe R quentlyquently the hoeing can be performed more perfectly, and with less expence. M. Chateauvieux likewise tried the lucern in Angle beds three feet wide, with Angle rows ; in beds three feet nine inches wide, with double rows ; and in beds four feet three inches wide, with triple rows. The plants in the Angle rows were Ax inches asunder, and those in the double and triple rows were about eight or nine inches. In a course of three years he found, that a Angle row produced more than a triple row of the same length. The plants of, lucern, when cultivated by tranfplantation, Aiould be at least Ax’inches asunder, to allow them room for extending their crowns. He further observes, that the beds or ridges ought to be raised in the middle; that a small trench, two or three inches deep, should be drawn in the middle; and that the plants ought to be set in this trench, covered with earth up to the neck. He says, that if the lucern be sown in spring, and in a warm soil, it will be ready for tranfplanting in September; that, if the weather be too hot and dry, the tranfplanting should be delayed till October; and that, if the weather be unfavourable during both these months, this operation must be delayed till spring. He further diredts, that the plants ftiould be carefully taken out of the nursery, so as not to damage the roots; that the roots be left only about Ax or seven inches long; that the green tops be cut off within about two inches of the crown; that they be put into water as soon as taken up, there to remain till they are planted; and that they should be planted with a plantingstick, in the f^me manner as cabbages. He does not give particular diredtions as to the times of horsehoeing; but only says in general, that the intervals should be stirred once in the month during the whole time that the lucern is in a growing st ate. He likewise observes, that great care ought to be taken not to fufter any weeds to grow among the plants, at least for the Arft two or three years; and for this purpose, that the rows, as well as the edges of the intervals where the plough cannot go, should be weeded by the hand. _ Of the Culture of Potatoes. The potatoe is one of the most useful roots that are cultivated in this country, and is raised in a very different manner from any of the other roots. It has a number of eyes in it, each of which produce a separate plant. The largest potatoes are the best for feed; because, when cut according to the eyes, and properly sown, the plants are not in danger of crowding each other. The plant sends out roots in every diredtion to a conftderable distance, and upon these the potatoes are formed. There are several kinds both of the white and red potatoes. They succeed best in a light dry soil; and though there be but a small mixture of loam in it, if tolerably rich and properly cultivated, it seldom sails to produce a good crop. But a good crop is not to be expedted from a stiff wet soil, unless it be laid up in ridges so as to make it dry, and a conftderable quantity of dung laid on to render it open. When the crop of potatoes is the chief point in view, the land should have a ploughing before winter, efpeciallyif the soil be not very free and open. If dung be necessary, the proper time for laying it on is before this ploughing. When the potatoes are to be planted, which may be done any time in March or beginning of April; the land must again be ploughed in narrow furrows, and the potatoes dropped into every second furrow. But if the land be open and very loose, they may be dropped into every furrow; and as the plough opens the furrow for the second row, it buries the Arft row at a proper depth. The furrow should not be very deep ; and two horses are fufEcient. It is better in this case to make the horses go abreast than in a, line; because, as one of them only goes in the furrow, the potatoes are not so liable to be hurt or displaced. This method of planting them by the plough is greatly preferable to the dibble or plantingstick. When a small quantity is intended to be cultivated, they may be planted with the spade. A small crosstrench or furrow should be opened with the spade at the end of the ridge. Into this furrow drop the potatoes at proper distances ; and, in making the next furrow, the roots laid in the Arft will be covered in the same manner as is done by the plough. According to the distance of the rows made by the plough,, the distance of the plants in the rows should be regulated: One plant in a square foot is sufficient to allow them to be properly hoed. When planted in every second furrow ploughed narrow, the rows will be about 12 or 14 inches asunder. The plants may he placed at the same distance in the rows. It is unnecessary to harrow uhe land after the potatoes are planted: This operation may be delayed till the weeds appear, which gives the farmer an opportunity of destroying them without any additional labour. Tho’ potatoes be planted early in the spring, or even before winter, they do not come up till May. Before that time, the weeds are far advanced; and, if they be not destroyed by the harrows, the land must be hoed. Indeed, the goodness of the crop depends so much upon preventing the weeds from coming to any height, that it is necefl’ary to hoe potatoes frequently. If the rows be wide, a kind of breasthoe may be used to throw the earth a little on each Ade, by which it will be raised about the plants. When two or three plants are in one piece, as often happens in light land, they should be cleaned with tire hand at the root, and only one stalk left to each plant. This not only gives air to the roots, but also prevents much of the nourishment from going into the stalks. When the hulk that contains the feed, or the apple, as it is commonly called, is completely formed, the stalks may be cut down and given to cows. Milkcows have been tried with this food ; they eat it very freely, and it. gives no bad flavour to the milk. The time of taking up potatoes is commonly regulated by the market. But, if nothing be in view but the largeness of the crop, they ought to stand till Odtober, or as long as they can be conveniently taken up before the frost sets in. The most expeditious method of taking, them up is by the plough: Eight or nine persons to attend67 A G R I C U attend the plough are sufficient. After the field is once ploughed, it ought to be harrowed, by which some of the potatoes will be raised ; and, when these are gathered, it ftiould be ploughed a second time. Of the Culture of Turnips. Turnips have been long cultivated in England, and, in some places, are esteemed one of the most valuable crops that can be raised. The trials made in Scotland have been very successful, which gives great encouragement to proceed. The goodness of the crop depends more on the openness of the soil than its richness. Land newly broke up is particularly proper for turnips. Though this kind of land be naturally poor, yet, with the afiiltance of a little dung, it seldom sails to produce an excellent crop. The land intended for turnips Ihould be ploughed and laid up in ridges before winter, that it may have the benefit of the frost. This winterploughing, however, is unheceifary when the land is dry and light: The spring is early enough for this kind of land. It may get a second ploughing in the end of May, and a third in the middle or end of June, when the feed is to be sown. Though three ploughings are here mentioned, no particulur number is intended ; for the land ought to be ploughed over and over,till it be thoroughly pulverifed. If dung be used, it should be well rotted, and laid on before the last ploughing. Turnipfeed is usually sown by the hand; and about half a pound is sufficient for an acre. It ffiould be mixed with sand; that it may be scattered the more equally. But sowing by a drill is'\''better than sowing by the hand, as, in this way, the plants can be more easily hoed, and thinned. Turnips should be hoed as soon as the. plants can be easily distinguished; for they gsow quickly, and, if they meet with any obftrudrion from, weeds, they are apt to become sickly* and, when this happens, they can never be recovered so as to produce a good crop. Turnips may be cultivated with great success by the new hulbandry. They have been tried in ilngle, double, and triple, rows, and, in alleys, from four to six feet wide, according to the situation of the land. The poorer the land is, or the more difficult to be reduced, the alleys ought to be the wider. After the ridges are formed, the turnip ffiould be drilled upon the crowns; and, as soon as they come up, and are pad all danger from the fly, they ffiould be horsehoed. The turnip is proper food, either for ffieep or black cattle. When the land is dry and needs manure, the ffieep may be folded on it: But the sold mull be removed every day; for it is improper to allow them to eat more at once than they can consume in that time. When the land is wet, or very rich, the turnip may be pulled, and the ffieep fed with them on another field that needs manure. But, when designed for black cattle, they must be pulled up and given them, either in flails or in another field, ■ as the farmer ffiall find most convenient. Of the Culture of Carrot. The carrot is but rarely cultivated in our fields : Indeed, the present market does not encourage the cultivation of this plant. But they have lately been found to be excellent food for horses; they eat them greedily, and are well fed by them. Carrots are not difficult to raise; a very small field is sufficient, and the trial may easily be made by any farmer, at a very small expence. The best crops of carrots, in our gardens, are produced by trenching. When the soil is hard below, though it be well dunged, it does not produce a good crop. Whenever the roots reach the hard soil, they become forked, e. the roots divide, which prevents them from growing large. Trenching makes the earth deep, and, by throwing what was on the surface into the bottom of the trench, lays good soil below for the roots to extend themfelve^ into. Something like this must be done in our fields before we can expedt a good crop. M. de Chateauvieux tried to raise a crop of carrots by the horsehoeing husbandry, and was very successful. He sowed them in beds six feet broad, on the 4th of May. He stirred the alleys with the spade on the 15th and 27th of July, and a third^ime on the 6th of September. They were digged up on the 8th of November, measured from 18 to 2 J inches in length, and from two to four in diameter, and weighed from 25 to 33 ounces. Land that has a hard bottom of clay or till is improper; and it is vain to expedt that such land can be prepared for carrots by the plough, without great trouble and expence. But, when land has a soft bottom, a good crop of carrots may be raised at a small expence by horfehoeing. As the feed, in this country, must be sown in March, the land ffiould get a ploughing before winter, and bo laid out in beds or ridges of the breadth proposed when the carrots are to be sown; the furrows betwixt these ridges ffiould be made as deep as possible, because it is'\'' upon these furrows that the rows of carrots are to be sown. A second ploughing in Winter should reverse the first, and turn the furrows into crowns; and,, before the carrots are sown, one bout of the plough may raise the crown of the ridge still higher. Upon these crowns the feed must be sovn out of the hand, into a small trench, drawn as straight as possible, and covered with a rake. When the weeds first appear, the remaining part of the ridges may be ploughed out, turning the earth to the rows, and taking care not to go so near as to cover the plants. Before the feed is sown, which is some time in March, instead of ploughing the whole ridge, the plough ffiould only go once about on the crown, to prevent the bad effects of too much moisture. As soon as the plants can be easily diftinguiffied,they ffiould be handhoed, and thinned where they stand too thick; and after this the alleys must be regularly hoed, as diredled in the culture of turnips. It is natural to expecft, that carrots raised in this way ffiould be freer from worms, and much better every way.way,'\'' than those railed in our gardens, except such as are sown upon newly trenched ground. Sect. VI. Principles and Advantages of the New Husbandry. The general principles of the new hufcandry may be reduced to two, viz? the promoting the growth of plants by hoeing, and the faring of feed; both of which are equally profitable to the farmer. But, before illuflrating these principles and advantages, it will be neceilary to describe the imiruments that are commonly used in cultivating land by this new method. Plate IX. fig. i. is a marking plough. The principal life of this plough is to {height and regulate the ridges. The firit line is traced by the eye, by means of three poles, placed in a streight line. The plough draws the first furrow ih the diredlion of this line; and, at the same time, with the tooth A, fixed in the block of wood near the end of the crosspoll or Aider B B, marks the breadth of the ridge at the diliance intended. The ploughman next traces the second line or rutt made by the tooth, and draws a small furrow along it; and continues in this manner till the whole field is laid out in streight and equidistant ridges. —Fig. 2. is a plough forbreakingup lee, or turning up the bottom of land when greatly exhausted. By its conftru&ion, the width and depth of the furrows can be regulated to a greater certainty than by any other hitherto known in this country. Its appearance is heavy; but two horses are ful Rcient to plough with it in ordinary free land; and only four are necessary in the stiffest clayjfoils. This plough is likewise easily held and tempered. A, is the sword .fixed in the fizers B, which runs thro’ a mortoife at theend of the beam E, and regulates the depth of the furrow, by raising or depressing the beam ; it is fixed by putting the pin D, through the beam and sword, and is moveable at E. r—Fig. 3. is a jointed break harrow with 24 teeth Ihaped like coulters, and (landing at about an angle of 80, degrees. By this inftrumentthe land is finely pulverifed, and prepared for receiving the feed from the drill. It requires four horses in stiff, and two in open land. This harrow is likewise used for levelling the ridges; this is done by pressing it down by the handles where the ridge is high, and raising it up when low. —Fig. 4. is an angular weeding harrow, which may follow the break when neceflary. The seven hindmost teeth fliould (land at a more acute angle than the rest, in order to colleft the weeds, which the holder can drop at pleasure, by raising the hinder part, which is fixed to the body of the harrow by two joints. —Fig. 5. is a pair of harrows with lhafts. This harrowis used for covering the feed in the drills, the horse going in the furrow. —Fig. 6. is a drillplough, cor.ftrucled in such a manner as to sow at once two rows of beans, pease, or wheat. This machine is easily wrought by two horses. A, is the happer for containing the feed; B, circular boxes for receiving the feed from the happer; C C, two square boxes which receive the feed from small holes in the circular boxes, as they turn round; and list of all, the feed is dropped into the drills through holes in the square boxes, behind the coulters D. The cylinder E follows, which, together with the wheel F, regulates the depth of the coulters, and covers the feed; the harrow G comes behind all, and covers the feed more completely. H H, two Aiders, which, when drawn out, prevent the feed from falling into the boxes ; and, I, is a ketch which holds the rungs, and presents the boxes from turning, and lofmg feed at the ends of the ridges. —Fig. 7. is a single hoeplough of a very Ample conftruclion, by which the earth, in tlse intervals, is stirred and laid up, on both sides, to the roots of the plants, and, at the same time, the weeds are destroyed.

The advantages of tillage before sowing have already been pointed out. In this place we must, confine ourselves to the utility of tillage after sowing. This kind of tillage is most generally known by the name of horfehoeing. Land sowed with wheat, however well it may be cultivated in autumn, sinks in the winter; the particles get nearer together, and the weeds rise; so that in spring, the land is nearly in the same situation as if it never had been ploughed. This, however, is the season when it Aiould branch and grow with most vigour; and consequently stands most in need of ploughing or hoeing, to destroy the weeds, to supply the roots with frefii earth, and, by dividing anew the particles of the soil, to allow the roots to extend and coiled: nourilhment. . It is well known, that, in gardens, plants grow with double vigour after being hoed or transplanted. If plants growing in Arable land could be managed with ease and safety in this manner, it is natural to exped, that their growth would be promoted accordingly. Experience Ihows, that this is not only praftie^ble, but attended with many advantages. In the operation of hoeing wheat, though Tome, of the roots be moved or broke, the plants receive no injury;, for this very circumstance makes them send forth a greater number of roots than formerly, which enlarge their pasture, and consequently augment their growth. Sickly wheat has often recovered its vigour after a good hoeing, especially when performed in weather not very hot or‘dry. Wheat, and such grain as is sown before winter, requires hoeing more than oats, barley, or other grain sown in the spring ; for, if the land has been well ploughed before the sowing of springcorn, it neither has time to harden nor to produce many weeds, not having been exposed to the winter’s mow and rain.Of 4 Sowing. As, in the praftice of the new hufoandry, plants grow with greater vigour than by the old method, the land should be sowed thinner. It is this principle of the new hufbaodry that has been chiefly objected to; for, upon observing the land occupied.by a small number of plants, people are apt to look upon all the vacant space as lost. But this prejudice will soon be removed, when it is considered, that, in the belt land cultivated in the common method, and sown very thick, each feed produces but. one or two ears; that, in the same land sown thinner, every feed produces two or three ears; and that a single feed sometimes produces eighteen or twenty ears. In the common method, as there are many more plants than can find fuflicient nourilhment, and as it is impoflible to aflift them by hoeing, numbers die before they attain maturity, the greatest part remain sickly and drooping; and thus part of the feed is lost. On the contrary, in the new method, all the plants have as much food asthey require; and as they are, from time to time, kffifted by hoeing, they become so vigorous as to equal in their production the numerous, but sickly plants cultivated in the common method. Gf Hoeing. The new hulbandry is absolutely impracticable in lands that are not easily ploughed. Attempting to cultivate land according to this hulbandry, without attending to this circumstance, that it is practicable in no land, excepting such as have already been brought into good tilth by the old method, lias gone far to make it contemptible in many places. When a field is in good tilth, it Ihould be sown .so thin as to leave fuffieient room for the plants to extend their roots. After being well ploughed and harrowed, it must be divided into rows, at the distance of 30 inches from one another. On the sides of each <Jf these rows, two rows of wheat must be fowgd six inches distant from each other. By this means there will be an interval of two feet wide betwixt the* rows, and every plant will have room enough to extend its roots, and to supply it with food. The intervals will likewise be sufficient for allowing the earth to be hoed or tilled without injuring the plants in the rows; The first hoeing, which Ihould be given before the winter, is intended to drain away the wet, and to dispose the earth to be mellowed by the frosts. These two ends will be answered by drawing two small furrows at a little distance from the rows, and throwing the earth taken from the furrows into the middle of the intervals. Tiiis first hoeing ftiould be .given when the wheat is in leaf. The second hoeing, which is intended to make the plants branch, .ftiould be given after die hard frosts are over. To do this with advantage, after furring the earth a little, near the rows, the earth which was thrown in the middle of the intervals ftiould be turned back into the furrows. This earth, having been mellowed by the Vol. I. No. 3. 3 L T IT R E. 6 9 winter, supplies the plants with excellent food, and makes the roots extend. The third hoeing, which is intended to invigorate the stalk, ftiould be given when the ears of the corn begin to ftiew themselves. This hoeing may, however, be very flight. But the last hoeing is of the greatest importance, as it enlarges the grain, and makes the ears fill at their extremities. This hoeing ihould be given when the wheat is in bloom ; a furrow must be drawn in the middle of the interval, and the earth thrown to the right and left on the foot of the plants. This supports the plants, prevents them from being laid, and prepares the ground for the next sowing, as the feed is then to be put in the middle of the ground that formed the intervals. By this fucceilive tillage, or hoeing, good crops will be obtained, provided the weather is not very unfavourable. But as strong, vigorous plants are longer before they arrive at maturity, corn railed in the new way is later in ripening than any other, and must therefore be sown earlier. In order to prepare the intervals for sowing again, some v/ellrotted dung may be laid in the deep furrows made in the middle of the intervals; and this dung must be covered with the earth that was before thrown towards the rows of wheat. But, if the land does not require mending, the deep furrow is filled without any dung. This operation should be performed immediately after harvest, that there may be time to give the land a flight stirring before the rows are sowed; which fliould occupy the middle of the space which formed the intervals during the last crop. The intervals of the second year take up the space occupied by the stubble of the first. Supposing dung to be neceflary, which is denied by many, a very fmail quantity is sufficient; a single layer, put in the bottom of each furrow, will be enough. Summary cf the Operations necejfary in executingthe New Husbandry with tlx Plough. r. It is indifpenfibly neceftary that the farmer be provided with a drill and hoeplough. 2. The new husbandry may be begun either with the winter or spring corn. 3. Tire land must be prepared by four good ploughings, given at different times, from the beginning of April to the middle of September. 4. These ploughings must be done in dry weather, to prevent the earth from kneading. 5. The land must be harrowed in the same manner as if it were sowed in the common way. 6. The rows of wheat should be sowed very straight. 7. When the field is not very large, a line must be strained across it, by which a rill may be traced with a hoe for the horse that draws the drill to go in; and, when the rows are sown, fifty inches must be left betwixt each rill. But, when the field is large, flakes at fiye feet distance from each other, must be placed at the two ends. The workman must then trace a small furrow, S withwith a plough that has no moldboard, for the horse to go in that draws the drill, direfting himself with his eye by the flakes. 8. The flowing should be fmifhed about the end of September, or beginning of October. 9. The furrows must be traced the long way of the land, that as little ground as possible may be lost in headlands i 10. The rows, if it can be done, ftiould run down the'\'' slope of the land, that the water may get the caller off. 11. The feedwheat must be plunged into a tub of limewater, andftirred, that the light corn may come to the surface and be Ikimmcd off. 12. The feed must next be flpread on a floor, and frequently stirred, till it is dry enough to run through the valves of the happer of the drill. 13. To prevent fmut, the feed may be put into a lye of alhes and lime. 14. After the happers of the drill are filled, the horse must go slowly along the furrow that was traced. That a proper quantity of feed may be sown, the aperture of the happer must be.suited to the size of the grain. 15. As the drill is seldom well managed at first, the field Ihould be examined after the corn has come up, and the deficiencies supplied. 16. Stiff lands that retain the wet, must be stirred or hoed in Offober. This Ihould be done by opening a furrow in the middle of the intervals, and afterwards filling it up by a furrow drawn on each side, which will raise the earth in the middle of the intervals, and leave two small furrows next the rows,, for draining off the water, which is very hurtful to wheat in winter. 17. The next stirring must be given about the end of March, with a light plough. In this stirring, the furrows made to drain the rows must be filled up by earth from the middle of the intervals.

Some time in May, the rows must be evened, which, though troublesome at first, soon becomes easy, as the weeds are soon kept under by tillage. 19. In June, just before the wheat is in bloom, another stirring must be given with the plough. A deep furrow must be made in the middle of the intervals, and the earth thrown upon the sides.of the rows. 20. When the wheat is ripe, particular care most be taken in reaping it, to trample as little as poflible on the ploughed land. 21. Soon after the wheat is carried off the field, the . intervals must be turned up with the plough, to prepare them for the feed. The great furrow in the middle ..must not only be filled, but the earth raised as much as poflible in the middle of the intervals. 22. In September, the land must be again sowed with a drill, as above directed. 23. In Odober, the stubble must be turned in for forming the new intervals; and the same management must be observed as direded in the first year. We pretend not to determine whether the old or new ■ husbandry be preferable in every country. With regard to this point, the climate, the fituatibn of particular land, fltill and dexterity in managing the machinery, the comparative expeuce in raising crops, and many other circumstances, must be accurately attended to before a determination can be given. One observation, however, may be made in favour of the new husbandry :—Though the particular modes of cultivating land by it are perhaps too limited to be universally adopted ; yet it has been of great use in raising suspicions concerning the old method, and in turning the views of philosophers and farmers towards improving in general. Many real improvements in agriculture have been the consequences of these suspicions; and as this spirit of inquiry remains in full vigour, particularly in our own country, a solid foundation is laid for expedting still further improvements in this useful art.
