The main program is geoground which takes input from stdin and
outputs to stdout. The input is in an XML format as in
scripts/in.xml. The output contains results in <place> elements
inside the original <placename> elements.  For example:

  cd scripts
  cat in.xml | ./geoground -g unlock

The obligatory -g parameter specifies the gazetteer to be
used. Possible values are:

* unlock: uses the standard Unlock service which combines all of
  the other options.
* geonames: the standard GeoNames service.
* unlock-geonames: the Unlock version of GeoNames.
* naturalearth: a gazteeer with global coverage but less detail than GeoNames.
* os: Ordnance Survey - useful for GB related documents.
* deep: historical England gazetteer.
* plplus: gazetteer of the ancient world.

By default geoground returns a ranking of the 20 best matches
with ranking encoded in @rank on <place> elements.
If you want just the top ranked use the -top flag:

  cat in.xml | ./geoground -g unlock -top

If you want to push geoground to prefer results in a particular
area, you can use the -l or -lb options. Use -l to specify a
bounding circle and -lb to specify a bounding box:

  -l lat long radius score
  -lb w n e s score

where score indicates how strongly to skew the results to the circle or box.
This is an example with a bounding box for the UK:

cat in.xml | ./geoground -g geonames -lb -10.5 60.9 1.9 49.7 5

To get a Leaflet map visualisation use the
lib/georesolve/gazmap-leaflet.xsl stylesheet like this:

cat in.xml |
./geoground -g unlock |
lxt -s ../lib/georesolve/gazmap-leaflet.xsl > map.html
